## Multifactorial Hypothesis and Multi-Targets for Alzheimer's Disease

Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia and is characterized by chronic, progressive neurodegeneration that leads to cognitive impairment and eventually to dementia. In familial, early onset AD, the disease is caused by certain mutations in the genes of presenilins or amyloid𝛃 protein precursor (A 𝛃 PP). Over 95% of AD cases are sporadic in nature and are not caused by any known gene mutations. Both familial and sporadic AD are characterized by two important brain lesions: aggregation of amyloid𝛃 (A 𝛃 ) into amyloid plaques and

The amyloid cascade hypothesis has been dominating drug discovery for Alzheimer's disease (AD) for the last two decades. The failure of the development of effective drugs for slowing down or reversing the progression of AD warrants the AD field to consider out-of-the-box thinking and therapeutic approaches. We propose the multifactorial hypothesis of AD, emphasizing that AD is caused by multiple etiological factors, which may result in common brain pathology and functional consequences through several separate but integrated molecular pathways. More than one etiological factor and mechanistic pathway may be involved in a single individual with sporadic AD, and different individuals may have different etiological factors, involving different mechanisms/pathways. We urge the recognition of the multifactorial nature of AD and the paradigm shift of AD drug development from a single target to multiple targets, either with the multitarget-directed ligands approach or the cocktail therapy approach. We believe that patient stratification and the use of the precision medicine model will also benefit AD drug discovery.

The modern era of AD research at the molecular level began in 1980s. During the last three decades, many molecular pathways involved in or relevant to the mechanisms of AD have been learned. However, modern AD research has not yet led to the development of any drug that can slow down the progression of AD or cure the disease. Only one drug, memantine, was developed that is still symptomatic and has moderate efficacy in temporarily reducing symptoms for only moderate or severe AD [1].

The failure of developing good effective drugs for AD, despite enormous amounts of resources and effort invested in the last 2-3 decades, led the AD field to think seriously what we have done, where we

stand now, and where we should head in AD research. This reconsideration is obviously seen in the last several years and has led many to doubt or even abandon the amyloid cascade hypothesis and shift their efforts to other possible mechanisms or targets, such as tau pathology, for their research and drug development [2-5]. At this transition time for AD research as well as the 110th year anniversary of the first publication of AD by Alois Alzheimer, it is especially timely and important to have a collection of ideas and opinions from AD experts, as organized by the Journal of Alzheimer ' s Disease , regarding the new beginnings of AD research.

have different etiological factors and involve somewhat different mechanisms/pathways. This article discusses the multifactorial mechanism and multitargets for AD.

## THE MULTIFACTORIAL HYPOTHESIS OF AD

Corrected Proof The failure of AD clinical trials to date could result from many reasons, which have been discussed recently [6-8]. These reasons include the complex nature of the disease, limits of animal models for preclinical studies, inadequate designs of clinical trials, and many others. One important reason is probably the lack of appreciation and understanding of the multifactorial nature and mechanisms of the disease. To date, most AD clinical trials have been based on a single mechanism or pathway. In addition to the dominant amyloid cascade hypothesis [9, 10], several other hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanisms of sporadic AD. These hypotheses include the cholinergic hypothesis [11, 12], tau hypothesis [13, 14], mitochondrial hypothesis [15, 16], oxidative stress hypothesis [17, 18], neuroinflammation hypothesis [19], brain insulin resistance hypothesis [20, 21], brain metabolic hypothesis [22-24], calcium hypothesis [25], innate immunity hypothesis [26, 27], and others. All these AD hypotheses are backed by substantial support from research data. This is actually not surprising because, as an age-associated neurodegenerative disease, many factors may initiate the development of AD and many molecular pathways may mediate the progression of the disease in the aged brain. However, a common problem of these hypotheses is that they intend to overemphasize the specific mechanism/pathway proposed and undervalue other mechanisms and heterogeneity. Such a narrow focus appears to attribute to the failure of AD drug development during the last decades. The development, growth, and maturation of a human body reaches its peak in the third decade of life. Human brain, as a special organ, may further mature for decades due to continuous learning and new experience. However, wearing and aging of the human brain starts at middle age. Normal aging is a constant balancing between physiological aging plus pathological risks/insults and the natural defense mechanisms (Fig. 1A). There are many risks and insults that occur and accumulate during aging, including genetic risks, epigenetic and metabolic factors, and environmental insults. The human body also responds to these factors/insults with its defense mechanisms, which could include general defense and those specific to individual insults. The balance between aging/insults and the defense mechanisms is dynamic and can shift within a certain range under physiological conditions. During normal aging, although the right side of the balance shown in Fig. 1A can be heavier as the accumulation of factors/insults, such as factor A to G, the balance tilts to the right side but still maintains within the normal range. However, as one or more of these factors/insults get heavier or new factors/insults (e.g., factor H, I, etc.) are added up, the imbalance eventually reaches the threshold and breaks the balance, i.e., initiation of the development of AD. These factors/insults collectively result in neurodegeneration, leading to cognitive impairment and eventually dementia, through individual molecular pathways (Fig. 1B). Some of these pathways involve in A 𝛃 overproduction/aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation/aggregation, leading the formationofamyloidplaquesandneurofibrillary tangles as the two hallmark brain lesions of AD.

Sporadic AD is caused by multiple etiological factors, which may result in common pathological brain damage and functional consequences through several separate but integrated molecular pathways. The multiple etiological factors and mechanistic pathways are likely involved in a single individual with sporadic AD, and different individuals may

Our proposed multifactorial hypothesis can perfectly explain why aging is the most important risk factor for AD, as the defense mechanisms on the left side of the balance shown in Fig. 1A becomes weaker during aging. On the other side, healthy lifestyle, such as physical and intellectual exercises and healthy diet, can help the defense mechanisms and thus inhibit or delay the onset of the disease.

Multifactorial mechanisms of AD have been proposed previously, which state that more than one etiopathological factors and mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of AD [28-30]. However, the multifactorial hypothesis of AD that we proposed here is different from those proposed previously. Our hypothesis emphasizes two key concepts for the development of AD. First, we emphasize that the development and onset of sporadic AD result from the collective effects of multiple factors/insults that are not restricted to one or more specific insults. This emphasis warrants targeting more than one insults/pathways simultaneously for effective AD therapy. Second, we emphasize that each individual may have a different combination of etiological factors/insults that cause the onset of AD in this particular individual. This emphasis recognizes the diversity of etiological factors and molecular mechanisms among individual AD cases and justifies the stratification of AD patients and the use of precision

Corrected Proof Fig. 1. The proposed multifactorial hypothesis of AD. A) The balance between the potential factors/insults accumulated during normal aging and the defense mechanisms. Worsening of these factors/insults (such as A to G) and/or adding of additional insults (such as H, I, etc.) can initiate the onset of AD. B) The multifactorial insults collectively cause neurodegeneration through multiple molecular mechanisms/pathways and consequently cognitive impairment and dementia. Some of these pathways also lead to the formation of amyloid plaques (AP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which are part of the end products of these pathways and also hallmark brain lesions of AD.

medicine concept for the treatment of AD, which will be discussed below.

The previously proposed hypotheses of AD, such as the amyloid cascade hypothesis, tau hypothesis, and neuroinflammation hypothesis, are all supported by more or less experimental and clinical evidence. Our proposed multifactorial hypothesis does not conflict with those hypotheses but include each of them as onefactor/insult for the disease development. Instead, we believe that we need to consider all parts of the issues of AD simultaneously when designing and testing new AD therapeutics. One major problem with previously proposed hypotheses is to emphasize one pathway but overlook or even ignore all others. This problem, in our opinion, partially accounts for the failure of all AD drug development so far.

An overview of the AD clinical trial data indicated that, over the last decade, more than 50 drug candidates have successfully passed phase II clinical trials, but none has passed phase III [31]. According to our proposed multifactorial AD hypothesis, it is not surprising that all the clinical trials targeting to a single pathway or mechanism critical to AD have failed so far. This is obvious because sporadic AD is caused by an imbalance of a collective action of several insults, as shown in Fig. 1. Inhibiting or removing only one of them is unlikely to be sufficient to restore the balance to the normal range. It is time for us to take a paradigm shift for AD drug development to a multitargets approach on the basis of the multifactorial AD hypothesis (Fig. 2).

Corrected Proof Each factor/insult of the right side of the balance of Fig. 1 may have different weights and contribute differently to the initiation and development of sporadic AD, and in different individuals the weight of each factor/insult may be different. Extensive research accumulated during the last three decades suggest many important factors/insults. They include aging, as well as genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, and environmental factors. Some of these factors/insults, such as mutations of presenilins and A 𝛃 PP, appear to be so strong that they can lead to early onset familial AD without co-existing of other insults. However, in most ADcases, amyloid or tau pathology is insufficient to lead to sporadic AD, as these pathologies can also be seen in the brains of individuals without cognitive impairment. STRATEGY TO TARGET THE MULTIFACTORIAL MECHANISM OF AD It is generally much more difficult to design a drug that can act at multiple targets. However, this is not impossible. A few groups in Europe and China have started the approach of multitarget-directed ligands (MTDL) for AD drug development [32-36]. The aim of MTDL design is to combine features that can interact with two or more of the desired targets. The MTDL molecules can be conceived to directly interact with multiple targets associated with ADby the molecular hybridization of different pharmacophoremoieties from already identified bioactive molecules [37, 38]. Each pharmacophore of the new hybrid drug can preserve the capacity of interacting with their specific sites on the targets and thus generate multiple specific pharmacological responses, which would enable the treatment of multifactorial AD. The development of MTDLs can prevent the challenge of simultaneously administering multiple drugs with potentially different degrees of bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism. Thus, this pharmacological approach can also provide patients with a simplification of the therapeutic regimen. Another approach, which is probably more practical, is to select substances of multiple actions against various insults/mechanisms involved in AD from nature sources. There are several natural compounds, such as isaindigotone, chelerythrine, chalcone, coumarin, huprine, curcumin, rhein, berberine, and resveratrol derivatives, that deserve investigation for AD drug development. This approach may indicate new directions for the development of new anti-AD drugs.

Fig. 2. Proposed strategies for AD drug development on the basis of the multifactorial hypothesis.

The third strategy is to consider simultaneous treatments with more than one drugs targeting various insults/mechanisms according to the multifactorial AD hypothesis. Such an approach had been used effectively in chemotherapy and in fighting against HIV/AIDS as the cocktail therapy. The cocktail therapy is proved to be essential to such an infective disease with a clear single cause, infection with the HIV virus. It actually makes more sense to employ such an approach for fighting

against AD, a disease with multiple etiologies and mechanisms.

Another important strategy for AD drug discovery is to stratify AD patients based on their likely factors/insults and test AD drug candidates in the stratified population of AD patients. Because the sporadic AD can be caused by a combination of various etiological factors and different molecular mechanisms/pathways may dominate in different populations, AD can be categorized into different subgroups, and different subgroups likely represent different etiopathogenic mechanisms and possibly also somewhat different clinical profiles. On the basis of the levels of tau, ubiquitin, and A 𝛃 1-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid, we were able to stratify AD patients into at least five subgroups [39]. Importantly, each of these five subgroups presented a different clinical profile. A recent study demonstrated structural variation in A 𝛃 fibrils from AD clinical subtypes [40], suggesting some molecular and structural basis for ADsubgroups. Therefore, testing a specific drug candidate in the stratified subgroup of AD patients, rather than the mixed populations of all AD patients, will certainly increase the likelihood of success in clinical trials. With the latest advances of brain imaging techniques and AD biomarkers, stratification of AD cases is now already feasible and will soon become more practical.

Precision medicine is a new medical model that proposes the customization of medical treatment and care to the individual patients. This model has been used successful for treating certain cancers [41]. In light of the unsuccessful investment of vast amount of effort and resources for AD drug discovery in the last two decades, it is time to make a paradigm shift and consider the precision medicine model for AD drug discovery and for future management of AD patients. Our knowledge of the disease-causing mutations of PSEN1, PSEN2 , and APP for familial AD and of ApoE alleles and polymorphisms of some genes, such as TREM2 , as risk factors for sporadic AD already maketheuseofprecision medicine model for treating AD possible. Brain imaging and biomarker data can add additional values for customization of individual AD patients.

Corrected Proof Initial efforts on the multi-target strategy for treating AD are mainly focused on the development of compounds that have ChE inhibitor activity (tacrineand donepezil-related derivatives) plus one or more properties of anti-A 𝛃 aggregation, 𝛃 -secretase inhibition, promotion of non-amyloidogenic cleavage of A 𝛃 PP, MAO inhibition, neuroprotection, anti-oxidation, metal-chelating, NMDA (N-MethylD-aspartate) antagonist, nitric oxide-releasing, antiinflammatory, tau hyperphosphorylation inhibition, and binding to serotonin receptors or opioid sigma 1 receptors. Tacrine is among the most popular pharmacophores used for the design of MTDLs since it is very active cholinesterase inhibitor. There is also a number of hybrid compounds containing fragments of donepezil, galantamine, or memantine. The pharmacologies and initial evaluations of these compounds have been recently reviewed by Guzior et al. [42] and Ismaili et al. [43] and thus are not discussed here in detail.

## MULTI-TARGETS FOR TREATING AD: CURRENT STATUS

The multifactorial nature of AD means that there are many potential therapeutic targets. Targeting these targets individually with current drugs has been ineffective for AD in clinical trials. A possible answer lies in a polypharmacological approach to modify activities of several of these targets simultaneously, especially those associated with the pathogenesis of the disease. The main therapeutic targets currently under investigation for treating AD include key proteins (A 𝛃 and tau) and their processing, receptors (cholinergic, glutamatergic, serotoninergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, histaminergic), enzymes (cholinesterase [ChE], 𝛂 -, 𝛃 -and 𝛄 -secretase, monoamine oxidases [MAO], O-GlcNAcase), and pathways/processes (insulin signaling, excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurogenesis, calcium and metal homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial damage), all of which have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.

Examples of these hybrid compounds under investigation comprise the dual binding site of ChE inhibitors with additional properties such as antiA 𝛃 aggregating activity [44, 45], neuroprotective and antioxidant activity [46, 47], calcium channel blocking [48, 49], cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonism [50], BACE-1 inhibition [51, 52], histamineH3receptorantagonism[53],NMDAreceptor channel blocking [54], serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonism [55], or serotonin transporter inhibition [56]. Other examples of dual-acting ligands are MAO-B inhibitors with iron-chelating agents [57], metal chelators with BACE-1 inhibitors [58], metal chelators with antioxidants [59], and modulators of

𝛄 -secretase with PPAR 𝛄 activities [60]. Most of these multifunctional ligands have been shown to display biological activity in vitro and require verification in animal models. However, several compounds like bis(7)-tacrine [61], ladostigil [62, 63] and memoquin [64] showed promising activity in vivo and in preclinical or even clinical studies.

Corrected Proof Several groups have synthesized and assessed compounds bearing the N-benzylpiperidine group present in donepezil and the N-propargylamine motif present in PF9601N, a potent and selective MAO-B inhibitor with neuroprotective activities in vitro and in vivo [34]. Both scaffolds were linked by different heterocyclic ring systems, such as pyridine, indole or 8-hydroxyquinoline, allowing facile synthesis of different MTDL molecules for AD therapy. In addition to inhibiting ChE and MAO, some of these new MTDL molecules also have antioxidant, anti-A 𝛃 -aggregating, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and metal-chelating properties. Preclinical studies suggest that these MTDL compounds can target the multiple pathways involved in the pathogenesis of ADandthusrepresent a potential improvement of the current pharmacological therapy of AD. One example of MTDL model that progressed to clinical trials against AD is ladostigil, designed to inhibit MAO and ChE but also incorporating potent anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activities [63]. The MTDL attempt combining activities of MAO and ChE has been reviewed recently [65]. The use of the well-known AD drugs donepezil, tacrine, or rivastigmine [47, 66] and bioactive natural products such as curcumin [67], berberine [68, 69], or 8-hydroxyquinoline [70]; as structural scaffolds for the development and search of new chemical entities with multiple properties for the treatment of AD has been investigated. These new hybrid compounds should be considered as simplified versions or lead drugs possessing potential as real alternatives to the current unsuccessful drugs for treating AD. Another approach for the multi-target AD drug development is repurposing, i.e., the development of existing or abandoned drugs for new indications, related to the original purpose or after off-target effects are identified by data mining. Repurposing can reduce the time to launch, cost of development, and the uncertainty associated with safety and pharmacokinetics. Data mining is a way of using preexisting knowledge about molecules and applying it to develop new drugs [71]. The most promising drug currently being investigated for repurposing is rasagiline, a selective, irreversible MAO-B inhibitor Another example of repurposing for AD treatment is anti-diabetic drugs. Diabetes is a known risk factor of AD, and brain insulin signaling is deregulated in AD[74, 75]. Our preclinical studies using AD mouse models indicate that several anti-diabetic drugs, including insulin sensitizers and intranasal insulin, are promising for reduction of AD-like brain pathologies and cognitive impairment [76, 77]. Studies on the repurposing of anti-diabetic drugs for the treatment of AD was reviewed recently in detail [78]. A phase II clinical trial of intranasal insulin administration in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild to moderate AD showed improved delayed memory and preserved caregiver-rated functional ability and general cognition [79]. Long-acting intranasal insulin detemir also improves cognition for adults with MCI or early-stage AD [80]. A recent randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled phase II trial also found that the treatment of MCI or mild to moderate AD patients with daily intranasal regular insulin for two to four months improved memory associated with preserved brain volume on MRI and reduction in the tau-P181/A 𝛃 42 ratio [81]. Three GLP-1 (glucagonlike peptide 1) analogs, which are used for treating diabetes, have shown in vivo benefits in mouse AD models [82] and potential therapeutic value in AD [83]. Liraglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that can cross the blood-brain barrier [84], ameliorate ADassociated brain pathologies and improve learning and memory in animal models [85-87]. This antidiabetic drug prevented the decline of brain glucose metabolism, synaptic dysfunction, and disease evolution of AD in a 6-month small clinical trial [88]. A multicenter randomized double-blind placebocontrolled phase IIb clinical trial for AD is currently undergoing (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/ NCT01469351). The GLP-1 analog Exendin-4 was also evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial (see https:// www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT01255163), but the results has not been published at the time of preparation of this article.

for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The repurposing for AD was due to its ability to regulate the non-amyloidogenic processing of A 𝛃 PP [72]. Rasagiline also has a neuroprotective activity due to the propargylamine moiety that activates Bcl-2 and downregulates the Bax proteins [73]. One phase II trial of rasagiline sponsored by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries was completed without publication of the results, and another phase II trial sponsored by the Cleveland Clinic is undergoing (https:// www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT02359552).

A few clinical trials have started to evaluate drug candidates in stratified AD patients with benefits. For example, a small clinical trial testing intranasal insulin in MCI and AD patients found that the treatment facilitated recall on two measures of verbal memory in memory-impaired ApoE4 carriers [89]. Insulin also differentially modulated plasma A 𝛃 according to ApoE genotype. Another trial testing the long-acting intranasal insulin, detemir, in MCI and AD cases found that the treatment enhanced memory for ApoE4 carriers but worsened it for noncarriers [80]. In a recent prevention trial for MCI and dementia, the subjects were stratified into four cohorts on the basis of age, ApoE genotype, sex, education, family history of dementia, vascular risk, subjective memory concerns, and baseline cognitive performance [90].

since all single AD drug clinical trials have failed to date.

Thecompletionofhumangenomestudyandrecent advances of brain imaging and biomarkers have made the stratification of AD patients for both clinical trials and future treatments not only possible but also practical. Computational and mathematical models based on individual genomic, epigenomic, neuroimaging, and biomarker data can optimize the stratification of AD patients for better therapeutic outcomes. These models can also serve for the precision medicine model for individual AD patients for customized medical treatment.

Corrected Proof CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES To date, most pharmacological research is driven to discover highly selective drugs. This strategy has failed to develop any drugs that can slow down or stop the progression of AD. The recognition of the multifactorial nature of AD warrants a paradigm shift of AD drug development from a single target into multiple targets, either with the MTDL approach or the cocktail approach. The therapeutic potential of multi-targets for the treatment of complex neurodegenerative diseases like AD must be recognized. Patient stratification and the use of precision medicine model will certainly benefit both single and multi-targets AD drug discovery. While there are many potential targets for disease-modifying drugs, it is important to prioritize and test which combinations will work. It seems logical that the pathways involved in synaptic and neuronal loss, rather than the deficiencies caused by cell death or AD lesions, must be targeted in order to slow down or reverse the disease progression. Of course, targeting a combination of both would theoretically relieve symptoms and prevent further neuronal loss. Therefore, combination of pharmacophores interacting withbothsymptomaticanddisease-modifyingtargets is highly justified for the initial research of MTDLs for AD. An international Alzheimer's Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI) was recently established through a collaboration of leading interdisciplinary clinicians and scientists devoted to the implementation of precision medicine model for fighting against AD [91, 92]. The successful implementation of this model in AD will likely result in breakthrough therapies with optimized safety profiles, better responder rates and treatment responses. Development of an effective drug for treating AD is clearly very challenging. Our experience indicates that there is no simple way of searching for AD therapy. The recognition of the multifactorial hypothesis of ADandtheconsideration of using the multi-targets approach gives hope for developing new and effective therapy for AD.
