In spite of profound investment and effort, numerous clinical trials targeting amyloidβ , which is thought to have a causative role in the disease, have not yielded any clinically meaningful success to date. Iron is an essential cofactor in many physiological processes in the brain. An extensive body of work links iron dyshomeostasis with multiple aspects of the pathophysiology of AD. In particular, regional iron load appears to be a risk factor for more rapid cognitive decline. Existing ironchelating agents have been in use for decades for other indications, and there are preliminary data that some of these could be effective in AD. Many novel iron-chelating compounds are under development, some with in vivo data showing potential Alzheimer ' s disease-modifying properties. This heretofore underexplored therapeutic class has considerable promise and could yield much-needed agents that slow neurodegeneration in AD.\\n\\nKey Words Alzheimer ' s disease . therapeutics . treatment . iron . chelation . ferroptosis\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nAround 50 million people have dementia worldwide, with nearly 10 million new cases each year. Dementia is one of the leading causes of disability among older people and was the fifth leading global cause of death in 2016. Alzheimer ' s disease (AD), the most common type of dementia, accounts for about two thirds of cases [1].\\n\\nPathologically, AD is characterized by cerebral atrophy, extracellular deposition of amyloidβ peptide in senile plaques, intraneuronal accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in neurofibrillary tangles, chronic inflammation, oxidative stress, and loss of neurons and synapses [2]. The predominant pathophysiological model for AD is the amyloid cascade hypothesis, first proposed in 1992 [3]. This posits that the causative and initial pathological event in AD is deposition of amyloidβ , which forms senile plaques.

To date, several dozen phase 3 trials have failed to meet primary endpoints. Recently, studies of aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody with promising initial data, were terminated after a futility analysis only to be revived when further data were analyzed in spite of controversy over these results due to the potential of unblinding [5, 6]. Some argue that the use of anti-amyloidβ therapeutics in the symptomatic stage of AD may be too late. This hypothesis is being tested in ongoing trials in presymptomatic amyloid-positive individuals at risk of sporadic AD [7] and in people with mutations in genes associated with dominantly inherited AD [8], but the multiple failures of prior amyloidβ -lowering agents does not bode well for the outcome of these studies. Furthermore, it is well-established that amyloidβ is often present in healthy older brains [9]. These data shed mounting doubt on the validity of the amyloid cascade hypothesis and whether amyloid-lowering therapeutics have any prospect of clinically meaningful efficacy. New aspects of neurodegeneration in AD need to be explored in order to pave the way to diseasemodifying therapeutics.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Iron and Oxidative Stress in the Brain\\n\\nOf particular interest is the potential role of ferroptosis, a form of nonapoptotic programmed cell death characterized by irondependent accumulation of lipid hydroperoxides to lethal levels [10], which has been implicated in a number of neurodegenerative disorders [11, 12].\\n\\nIron is an essential cofactor for many physiological functions [13]. The ability to easily gain or lose electrons makes it well suited for metabolic processes, such as the transport and activation of small molecules and electron transfer [13, 14]. The vast majority of the 5 g or so of iron in the body is found in hemoglobin and myoglobin, as well as the storage proteins ferritin and hemosiderin. Only a few hundred milligrams are involved in critical enzymatic processes which capitalize on iron ' s variable coordination chemistry, permitting it to exist in different oxidation states, including 0, + 2, + 3, + 4, and + 6. Ferrous (Fe 2+ ) and ferric (Fe 3+ ) iron and are the most common in biological systems [13].\\n\\nThe brain has a high demand for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) to maintain membrane ion gradients, synaptic transmission, and axonal transport. Iron is part of cytochromes a, b, and c, cytochrome oxidase, and the iron-sulfur complexes of the oxidative chain, making it essential for ATP production [15]. Iron is also involved in the synthesis of neurotransmitters, as well as lipids and cholesterol, which are substrates for myelin synthesis [14, 16 -18]. Although iron is essential for normal brain functioning, it is toxic in the case of overload or dyshomeostasis, which can cause neurodegeneration by disrupting mitochondrial function, depleting ATP, and inducing oxidative damage and chronic inflammation, resulting in damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA [14, 15, 19 -22]. Cognition, motor function, dopamine-related functions, and myelinogenesis are commonly affected in CNS iron dysregulation [15].\\n\\nThe ability of iron to undergo oxidation -reduction allows it to convert hydrogen peroxide to toxic free radicals, leading to oxidative stress and cell death via the Fenton reaction, first described in 1894 [14, 23, 24]. When free iron donates an electron to hydrogen peroxide, a hydroxyl radical is produced, which is one of the most reactive free radical species known: Fe 2+ + H2O2 → Fe 3+ + · OH + OH -[14, 24]. Iron-induced oxidative stress causes a positive-feedback loop of additional iron release from ferritin, heme proteins, and iron-sulfur clusters [14]. Free iron is more likely to exchange electrons with nearby molecules than when protein-bound, leading to further free radical production [14]. When free radicals are generated near membrane phospholipids, they initiate peroxidation of polyunsaturated fatty acids, leading to production of lipid hydroperoxides which break down to form lipid-derived α , β -unsaturated 4-hydroxyaldehydes [25, 26]. Free radical-induced modifications to proteins leads to the addition of reactive carbonyl functional groups, generated from lipid peroxidation, glycation, and amino acid oxidation [27, 28].\\n\\nAlthough most models of iron-mediated neuronal injury involve Fenton-mediated hydroxyl radicals, an alternative model posits that depletion of reduced glutathione decreases activity of monothiol glutaredoxins and decreased incorporation of iron into target metalloproteins. This leads to an increase in available iron in the cell, which is diverted to the chaperone poly(rC)-binding protein 1 and hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases (HIF PHDs) in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Increased HIF PHD1 activity results in enhanced transcription of activating transcription factor 4-dependent pro-death genes and induction of ferroptotic death [29].\\n\\nIt is unsurprising that free iron levels are tightly regulated. Iron is generally bound to chaperone proteins in order to control its reactivity, restricting it to specific locations where it cycles between reduced (Fe 2+ ) and oxidized (Fe 3+ ) states as part of physiological processes [30, 31]. In the plasma, iron exists primarily as Fe 3+ bound to transferrin [14]. The main protective strategy to prevent iron overload in the brain is selective transport systems on the blood -brain barrier [32]. Iron-transferrin complexes circulating in the blood cross the blood -brain barrier via endocytosis mediated by the transferrin receptor (TfR) on the surface of capillary endothelial cells [32]. Iron is then transported from the basolateral membrane of endothelial cells to the cerebral compartment, where it is available to neurons and glia [14]. Nontransferrin-bound iron can enter via lactoferrin receptors [33]. Intracellular free iron exists in the reduced form Fe 2+ , which acts as a cofactor for iron-dependent enzymes in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus [32]. Intracellular iron levels are controlled by ironregulatory proteins that bind iron-responsive elements in mRNA [23]. Anti-oxidant defenses inhibit damage caused by free radicals, via the enzymes superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) [13, 14], as well as nonenzymatic anti-oxidant substances such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), carotenoids, and flavonoids [14].\\n\\n## Brain Iron Is Elevated in Alzheimer ' s Disease\\n\\nAccumulating evidence suggests that iron excess and dyshomeostasis contribute to neurodegeneration in AD [12, 32]. Several of the biological abnormalities seen in AD are consistent with free radical damage from impaired iron homeostasis [34].\\n\\nIron elevation was first shown in the brains of people with AD in 1953 [35]. Elevated brain iron in AD has been confirmed in numerous subsequent studies both post mortem [36 -42] and in vivo [36, 38, 42 -53]. Iron rises in the brain with aging and may be pathological because it is associated with cognitive decline prior to disease [54, 55]. Increased iron\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\noccurs as early as the mild cognitive impairment stage of AD and contributes to longitudinal outcomes [56, 57]. Iron and ferritin are found within plaques, NFTs, and blood vessels in AD [42]. Although an increase in brain iron levels may contribute to AD pathology, it is excessive iron in specific intracellular compartments or regions of the brain, i.e., regional siderosis, that appears to drive neurotoxicity, particularly in the cortex and hippocampus [14, 36, 42, 58, 59].\\n\\nSeveral MRI modalities can be used to image iron levels. T2* MRI allows semiquantitative measurement of brain iron, though the results are influenced by differences in crystal structure, unequal clustering of ferritin, and the size of the magnetic particle [60]. Severity of AD pathology correlates with iron accumulation on postmortem T2*-weighted MRI [61]. Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) is more specific than other MRI modalities as a measure of tissue magnetic susceptibility and correlates well with brain iron levels [62]. QSM imaging demonstrated increased brain iron levels in multiple regions of interest in people with AD compared to controls [63]. QSM also correlates with clinical measures. Higher hippocampal QSM levels predicted accelerated decline in episodic memory, and temporal and frontal QSM levels predicted deteriorating performance on a language task [64]. Magnetic susceptibility in the left caudate also correlated with declining scores on the Mini-Mental State Examination and Montreal Cognitive Assessment in mild and moderate AD [62]. A recent Australian Imaging Biomarker and Lifestyle prospective study found that when brain iron load measured by MRI was compared in normal elderly and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD subjects, brain iron loading was exaggerated in a manner that correlated with cognitive impairment [65].\\n\\nBrain iron load also impacts longitudinal AD outcomes [66]. Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) ferritin, a reporter of brain iron burden [67, 68], independently predicted conversion to AD and was associated with poorer cognition and hippocampal atrophy [69]. CSF ferritin levels are associated with disease progression in prodromal people with high amyloidβ pathology determined by CSF t-tau/A β 42 ratio [70]. High CSF ferritin levels are also associated with accelerated depreciation of CSF A β 1-42, from threshold preclinical levels to the average level of Alzheimer ' s subjects, suggesting that iron may facilitate amyloidβ deposition, accelerating the process of AD [71]. Plasma ferritin levels are elevated in cognitively normal amyloid PET-positive older subjects compared to controls with low neocortical amyloid load [72], suggesting that impaired iron mobilization is an early event in AD pathogenesis [72]. The magnitude of impact of CSF ferritin on AD outcomes is commensurate with the tau/A β 42 ratio, previously one of the best CSF diagnostic biomarkers for AD [73]. CSF ferritin thus appears to be a complementary prognostic biomarker to the t-tau/A β 42 ratio that predicts near-term disease progression risk [64].\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nIn addition to ferritin, other proteins involved in iron transport correlate with AD symptoms. CSF levels of melanotransferrin, a transferrin homolog that binds iron, are associated with conversion of MCI to AD [74]. Hepcidin is a regulatory protein present in the brain which binds to the iron channel ferroportin, leading to decreased export of cellular iron [75 -77]. Serum hepcidin levels are raised in AD and correlate, albeit weakly, with the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale [75]. Although it is possible that the finding of raised serum hepcidin could have been the result of inflammationbased induction of hepatic hepcidin production, values did not correlate with C-reactive protein levels in this cohort, though subjects with levels greater than 5 mg/l were excluded [75]. In the healthy brain, hepcidin and ferroportin are widely distributed and colocalize in neurons and astrocytes, suggesting a role for these proteins in regulating neuronal iron release. In AD brains, hepcidin expression is reduced and anatomical distribution is restricted to neuropil, blood vessels, and damaged neurons [76]. Brain ferroportin levels are also reduced in AD, potentially secondary to ischemia, inflammation, neuronal loss, and senile plaque formation [76]. The reason for reduced hepcidin levels in AD brain are less certain, but reduced passage across damaged vascular endothelium is one possibility [29].\\n\\nSome potential sources of increased brain iron deposits include bleeding, iron-containing macrophages crossing the blood -brain barrier, and dysregulated blood -brain barrier iron transport [78]. Phagocytic cells containing iron are often present in areas of neurodegenerative changes. These cells may have migrated to these regions in order to phagocytose iron, or iron-containing phagocytic cells may enter the central nervous system as part of an inflammatory response [78]. Lysosomal dysfunction may also be a source of increased CNS iron uptake [78].\\n\\n## Amyloid Precursor Protein in Iron Transport and Oxidative Stress\\n\\nThere is a complex interplay between amyloidβ , tau, and iron in both physiological and pathological states, which can be used to integrate the role of iron into a modified version of the amyloid cascade hypothesis.\\n\\nAmyloidβ is generated from amyloid precursor protein (APP) [79], a single-pass transmembrane protein with high levels of expression in the brain [80]. APP helps protect cells from iron-catalyzed oxidative stress by loading Fe 3+ onto transferrin and stabilizing the iron export channel ferroportin [36]. APP knockout mice have decreased ferroportin levels and increased levels of age-related iron accumulation with concomitant oxidative stress in cortical neurons [36]. APP may thus act to oppose brain iron elevation during normal aging [81]. APP levels are modulated by an iron-responsive\\n\\nelement (IRE) in the 5 ′ untranslated region of the APP transcript [82, 83]. In conditions of high iron, such as Alzheimer ' s disease, APP translation is increased [84]. Iron regulation of APP mRNA suggests that this could be a target for iron chelators [82]. Intracellular iron chelation increased binding of iron-responsive element-binding protein 1 to the APP IRE, decreasing APP expression [82, 83].\\n\\nDysregulation of iron homeostasis is a common effect of mutations in the genes involved in early-onset familial Alzheimer ' s disease, PSEN1 , PSEN2 , and APP . PSEN and APP may be involved in regulation of iron homeostasis throughout the aging process [85].\\n\\n## Iron Binds Amyloid and Tau, Promoting Toxicity\\n\\nIron binds amyloid in vitro [86] with an affinity eight times higher than that in transferrin [87] and is elevated in senile plaques [14, 35]. X-ray microscopy techniques at submicron resolution in the APP/PS1 mouse model of AD showed a direct correlation of amyloid plaque morphology with iron as well as evidence for the formation of an iron -amyloid complex [88]. Magnetite iron species was shown in plaques, suggesting aberrant iron redox chemistry [88]. Quantitative susceptibility mapping compared with flutemetamol positron emission tomography (PET) showed local correlation between β -amyloid plaque and iron deposition in healthy older adults without dementia [89].\\n\\nTau, the main component of neurofibrillary tangles, helps mediate iron efflux from cells [90]. High levels of iron colocalize with tau in neurofibrillary tangles [90, 91]. Iron promotes tau hyperphosphorylation by inducing kinases and possibly also by impacting protein phosphatase 2A activity [90, 92]. Iron also causes aggregation of hyperphosphorylated tau [93 -95] via an iron-binding motif in the tau protein [90].\\n\\n## Amyloidβ Plaques Are a Site of Redox Activity, Facilitated by Iron\\n\\nIron causes amyloidβ aggregation in vitro [96 -98] and promotes A β aggregate toxicity [99 -101]. The affinity of amyloidβ for iron increases following aggregation, and further iron binding leads to additional neuronal cytotoxicity [97, 99 -104]. Protein carbonyl groups, markers of oxidative damage to DNA and proteins, are seen in preclinical and established Alzheimer ' s disease [105, 106].\\n\\nAmyloidβ plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are major sites of redox reactivity, which is catalyzed by iron binding [30, 34, 42, 87, 98]. In vitro studies show that amyloidβ captures and reduces Fe 3+ from the ferritin core, leading to intraneuronal Fe 2+ elevation [36, 107] and production of hydrogen peroxide. Hydroxyl radicals may then contribute to oxidative damage on both the amyloidβ peptide and surrounding molecules including proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, with concomitant disruption of membrane integrity [30]. Oxidation also impairs amyloidβ clearance by the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP1) [30]. Elevated levels of A β 1-40 and A β 1-42 are associated with increased levels of oxidation products in the AD hippocampus and cortex [108]. Given that iron appears to contribute to amyloidβ -mediated toxicity, it is possible that ironmodifying therapies may have benefit where other modalities of anti-amyloidβ therapeutics have failed.\\n\\n## Iron Overload Impairs Microglia, Increasing Reactive Oxygen Species Production\\n\\nIron overload causes microglia to take on a senescent phenotype with reduced motility and altered surveillance. When confronted with injury, they produce a more sustained inflammatory response with increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. It is possible that microglia are pushed to a more pro-inflammatory phenotype by age-related changes [109]. Stimulation of cultured microglia with amyloidβ induces an inflammatory phenotype, causing these cells to retain iron, and reduces their phagocytic and chemotactic functioning [110]. Microglia extracted from APP/PS1 mice also have an iron-retentive phenotype with reduced amyloidβ phagocytotic ability [110].\\n\\n## Ferroptosis in AD\\n\\nFerroptosis, first described in 2012, is biochemically and morphologically distinct from other forms of cell death such as apoptosis and necrosis and is characterized by iron-dependent accumulation of lipid peroxides [10, 11]. Ferroptosis is induced by the small molecule erastin, which inhibits cysteine import via the cystine-glutamate antiporter system Xc-, leading to depletion of glutathione, a tripeptide formed from cysteine, glutamate, and glycine [10]. Glutathione is a substrate for the selenoenzyme glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4), which converts potentially toxic lipid hydroperoxides to nontoxic lipid alcohols [111 -113]. Morphological features of ferroptosis include small mitochondria with condensed mitochondrial membrane densities, reduction or vanishing of mitochondrial crista, outer mitochondrial membrane rupture, and electron lucent nuclei [114, 115].\\n\\nFerritinophagy may play a critical role in the regulation of ferroptosis [116]. When ferroptosis is induced via cysteine depletion, nuclear receptor coactivator 4 mediates the autophagic degradation of ferritin (ferritinophagy), leading to release intracellular free iron [116]. HER2C, a modulator of\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nferritinophagy [116], regulates turnover of FBXL5, which is part of a complex that targets iron regulatory protein 2 for proteasomal degradation and thus appears to play a role in iron metabolism [117]. HERC2 deficiency could induce neurodegeneration by impairing response to increased iron levels, leading to ferritinophagy, release of free iron, and neuronal damage [116].\\n\\nErythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a transcription factor that regulates genes involved in the metabolism of glutathione, iron and lipids, and mitochondrial function [118]. Nrf2 may help protect against ferroptosis, and enhancing Nrf2 signalling may hence be neuroprotective [118].\\n\\nEmerging work suggests that ferroptosis may play a role in AD pathology. Lipid peroxidation levels are elevated in the brain in AD [119, 120]. Mice with a conditional deletion of GPX4 display cognitive impairment and hippocampal degeneration similar to that of AD with neurodegenerative features of ferroptosis (including lipid peroxidation, extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) activation, and neuroinflammation), which is ameliorated by a ferroptosis inhibitor [121]. Ferroptosis may exacerbate AD by targeting the hypoxiainducible factor 1 α and heme oxygenase-1 pathways [116].\\n\\nFerroptosis is modulated by pharmacological perturbation of lipid repair systems involving glutathione and GPX4 [11]. Cell death caused by ferroptosis can be suppressed by iron chelators, lipophilic anti-oxidants, inhibitors of lipid peroxidation, and depletion of polyunsaturated fatty acids [11]. Some ferroptosis inhibitors appear in Table 1 [11].\\n\\nStudies of therapeutics with potential anti-ferroptosis activity show promise, though there are few data from human studies. Trials of vitamin E supplementation to prevent cognitive decline or treat AD have produced conflicting results [122]. Donepezil-butylated hydroxytoluene hybrids have been designed as potential anti-AD therapies [123]. Studies of idebenone have shown cognitive improvement in AD, but conclusive evidence for a benefit of sufficient magnitude to be clinically significant is lacking [124 -126]. In rat models of AD, vildagliptin modulated AD-associated biochemical changes [127], reduced tau phosphorylation, increased the expression of proteins associated with synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus [128], attenuated amyloidβ , and improved memory [129]. Linagliptin mitigated cognitive deficits, as well as attenuating amyloidβ , tau phosphorylation, and neuroinflammation in a 3xTg-AD mouse model [130]. In cultured human neuronal cells, linagliptin alleviated amyloidβ -induced mitochondrial dysfunction and intracellular ROS generation [131]. Studies of deferoxamine and deferiprone in AD are discussed below. Baicalein improved cognition decreased amyloidβ and prevented tau phosphorylation in AD mouse models [132, 133]. PD-146176 preserved memory, lowered amyloidβ , decreased tau pathology, and reduced autophagy in a 3xTg mouse model of AD [134, 135]. Zileuton improved memory and reduced amyloidβ and tau pathology\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Table 1 Ferroptosis inhibitors\\n\\nLipid peroxidation inhibitors\\n\\n- Vitamin E\\n- Deuterated polyunsaturated fatty acids\\n- Butylated hydroxytoluene\\n- Butylated hydroxyanisole\\n- Ferrostatins\\n- Liproxstatins\\n- Coenzyme Q10\\n- Idebenone\\n- Gliptins (vidagliptin, alogliptin, linagliptin)\\n\\nIron depleters\\n\\n- Deferoxamine\\n- Cyclipirox\\n- Deferiprone\\n\\nLipoxygenase-induced lipid peroxidation inhibitors\\n\\n- CDC (cinnamyl-3,4-dihydroxyα -cyanocinnamate)\\n- Baicalein\\n- PD-146176\\n- AA-861\\n- Zileuton\\n\\nSystem Xc- inhibitor blockers\\n\\n- Cycloheximide\\n- 2-Mercaptoethanol\\n\\nBlocker of GPX4 degradation\\n\\n- Dopamine\\n\\nIncreased selenoproteins\\n\\n- Selenium\\n\\nModified from Stockwell et al.

A small randomized controlled pilot trial of supra-nutritional sodium selenate in AD showed that subjects whose CSF selenium concentrations raised with treatment had reduced deterioration on the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE) [138].\\n\\n## Ideal Aspects of Chelators\\n\\nThere are a number of factors that potentially affect the efficacy and tolerability of iron chelators for AD and other neurodegenerative disorders.\\n\\nThe efficiency with which a chelator binds iron and its transmembrane transport properties appear to be major factors in efficacy [139]. A chelator for AD obviously needs to penetrate the blood -brain barrier. Chelators can remove iron from the site of accumulation directly, or transfer it to other molecules.\\n\\nUse of nonselective chelators may affect the homeostasis of iron-dependent processes, such as depleting transferrin-bound iron in the plasma, leading to side effects [140, 141]. Moderate affinity chelators may be less likely than high-affinity chelators to remove metals from physiological processes [142]. Another strategy is utilizing site- or process-specific chelators,\\n\\nsuch as pro-chelators, which have little affinity for metal ions until they undergo a chemical conversion in response to a specific stimulus [141]. Agents that target disease-specific pathophysiology, such as anti-ferroptotics, may also achieve the aim of modulating a disease process without affecting normal physiology. Given that iron may drive cell death by activating iron-sensing hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl hydroxylases, these could be a target of protection from ferroptosis via iron chelation [29].\\n\\n## Iron Chelators Currently Available\\n\\nIron chelators are currently used clinically for transfusiondependent patients with iron overload and beta thalassemia major, sickle cell anemia, myelodysplasia, and aplastic anemia [143]. They are also used rarely in people with hemochromatosis who are unsuitable for phlebotomy due to severe cardiac involvement and unstable hemodynamics and in people with acute iron poisoning [143]. There are three iron chelators in widespread clinical use: deferoxamine, deferasirox, and deferiprone (Table 2) [143].\\n\\nDeferoxamine is a siderophore obtained from Streptomyces pilosus which has been in clinical use since the 1970s [141, 144]. It is hydrophilic and large, with subsequent poor oral bioavailability, and poor blood -brain barrier permeability [144]. It also has a short half-life. Deferoxamine appears to act on extracellular iron [145]. It inhibits the iron redox cycle and modulates gene expression of hypoxia-inducing factor, iron regulatory protein-1, and APP, potentially blocking production of reactive oxygen species [146]. Deferoxamine binds in a 1:1 ratio with iron and is subsequently excreted in the urine and feces [147].\\n\\nIn APP/PS1 double transgenic mice, intranasal deferoxamine inhibited APP processing, induced activation of M2 microglia with amyloidβ phagocytic activity while inhibiting M1proinflammatory microglia, and improved cognitive function [146, 148]. Deferoxamine also reduced amyloid [149] and tau [150] pathology in animal AD models.\\n\\nIn 1991, a placebo-controlled phase II clinical trial reported that 125 mg intramuscular deferoxamine dosed twice daily five times a week slowed cognitive decline in subjects with AD by 50% over a 24-month period [151]. This remains one of the few clinical trials for a potentially disease-modifying\\n\\nTable 2 Iron chelators in current clinical use\\n\\n| Agent        | Oral bioavailability   | Blood - brain barrier passage   |\\n|--------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|\\n| Deferoxamine | No                     | Poor                            |\\n| Deferasirox  | Yes                    | Limited                         |\\n| Deferiprone  | Yes                    | Good                            |\\n\\ndrug in AD that his shown cognitive benefit. At the time, the results were attributed to binding of brain aluminum [151]. The evidence for environmental exposure to aluminum playing a role in AD subsequently weakened [152], and the t r i a l was never followed up t o our knowledge. Deferoxamine ' s affinity for Fe 3+ , however, is six times greater than for Al 3+ , and iron is 1000-fold more abundant in the brain than aluminum, which suggests the positive results were due to iron chelation, rather than an effect on aluminum.\\n\\nDeferasirox is an orally bioavailable high-affinity iron chelator which is capable of intracellular iron chelation. In rats, deferasirox prevented age-related accumulation of iron, reduced ferritin and transferrin receptor expression, and reversed altered amyloidβ metabolism [153]. Blood -brain barrier passage is limited, but improves when conjugated with lactoferrin [154]. Deferasirox binds at a 2:1 ratio to iron and is excreted in the feces [147]. Lactoferrin-deferasirox conjugates attenuated learning deficits induced by amyloid injection in a rat model of AD [154].\\n\\nDeferiprone is an orally bioavailable siderophore with moderate iron-binding affinity [142, 144], which has been in clinical use since the 1980s [141]. It readily crosses the blood -brain barrier and chelates intracellular iron [145]. It is less aggressive than deferoxamine, which readily depletes the body of iron. Deferiprone penetrates cellular membranes, forms a complex with iron, exits cells, and can redistribute iron to transferrin for reuse [155, 156]. It binds iron with a 3:1 chelator/iron ratio and is primarily excreted via the kidneys [147].\\n\\nDeferiprone is neuroprotective in neuronal culture models of amyloidβ toxicity [157, 158], protecting against hydrogen peroxide and A β 1-40-induced neuronal death [158]. It attenuates amyloid burden and tau phosphorylation in a rabbit model of AD [159].\\n\\nClinical trials of deferiprone have taken place in a number of neurodegenerative disorders. A pilot study in Friedreich ' s ataxia, followed by a 6-month randomized controlled trial, showed that deferiprone can safely reverse pathological brain iron accumulation [155, 160]. A 12-month trial in neurodegeneration with brain accumulation followed, demonstrating that deferiprone was well tolerated over longer time frames [161]. FAIR-PARK 1, a phase II trial in Parkinson ' s disease, also showed that deferiprone was well-tolerated and did not lead to iron depletion [67]. Motor symptoms improved and R2* MRI showed a reduction in iron deposition in the substantia nigra [67]. FAIR-PARK 2, a phase III trial of deferiprone in Parkinson ' s disease, is nearing completion, with results expected in mid-2020.\\n\\nAclinical of deferiprone in Alzheimer ' s disease is currently underway, the Deferiprone to Delay Dementia (3D Study; ClincalTrials.gov Identifier NCT03234686). This is a phase II randomized controlled study investigating the safety and efficacy of deferiprone in subjects with prodromal and mild\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nAD. The primary outcome i s performance on a neuropsychological test battery. Secondary outcomes include brain iron levels as measured by MRI (T2*, QSM).\\n\\nClioquinol is an 8-hydroxyquinoline analogue. It is a copper/zinc ionophore and a moderate iron chelator [162]. It was withdrawn from clinical use due to a purported association with subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy, though whether an association exists is not clear [163]. Complications with large-scale manufacturing prevented further developments [162]. Clioquinol dissociates metals from binding sites in A β , decreases iron-associated A β 42 aggregation [164], and stimulates amyloid degradation pathways via metaldependent signalling. In a placebo-controlled phase II trial of 32 patients, clioquinol prevented cognitive deterioration and lowered plasma A β -42 levels [165].\\n\\n## Iron Chelators Under Development with Potential in Alzheimer ' s Disease\\n\\nA number of compounds with iron-chelating activity have shown potential in in vivo AD models. There are also numerous novel compounds which have recently been developed (Table 3), some of which are described below.\\n\\nMonoamine oxidase B leads to an increase in hydrogen peroxide and free radicals. A series of compounds combining MAOinhibition with iron chelation activity have been developed [166 -168]. One of these, M30, is an orally bioavailable iron chelator which crosses the blood -brain barrier has shown promise in cell line and animal models. It combines monoamine oxidase A and B inhibitory activities with the antioxidant chelator moiety of VK28, an 8-hydroxyquinoline derivative [169]. M30 reduced APP expression and A β\\n\\nTable 3 Some iron chelators and related compounds under development with potential in AD\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\ngeneration in vitro and reduced amyloidβ plaques in aged mice [169]. In APP/PS1 mice, it attenuated cognitive impairments, reduced cerebral iron accumulation, decreased cerebral APP levels, and reduced amyloidβ and tau levels [170]. This drug has not yet been tested in humans with AD to our knowledge.\\n\\nThere are several other iron chelators with in vitro evidence in support of a potential benefit in AD. A novel class of 2amido-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one iron chelators shows neuroprotective properties in cell cultures against β -amyloidinduced toxicity [171]. Hydroxylated chalcones have recently been designed as dual-function inhibitors, with action against amyloidβ peptide aggregation and ferroptosis [172]. These have been shown in cell lines to provide protection against A β 1-42 aggregation-induced toxicity and against ferroptosis [172]. HLA20A is a selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with site-activated chelating activity. It is activated following inhibition of acetylcholinesterase to liberate an active chelator, HLA20, which has neuroprotective activities. It has been shown to lower APP expression and amyloidβ generation and to reduce iron-induced aggregation [173].\\n\\nA number of other dual-function therapeutics have been developed with iron-chelating and acetylcholinesteraseinhibiting properties. Tacrine-(hydroxybenzoyl-pyridone) hybrids, combining acetylcholineserase inhibition and iron-chelating capacity have been developed [174]. There are also tacrine-deferiprone hybrids [175]. Novel dihydropyrimidinone-derived selenoesters have been synthesized with anti-oxidant activity via lipid peroxidation inhibition and iron chelation activity as well as acetylcholinesterase inhibition [176]. Quinazoline and pyrido(3,2-d)pyrimidine, and 3-hydroxy-4-pyridinone)-benzorufan-based compounds have also been synthesized, with dual cholinesterase\\n\\n| Agent                                           | Mechanism of action                      |\\n|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|\\n| M30                                             | MAO-I + IC                               |\\n| 2-Amido-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one compounds        | IC                                       |\\n| Hydroxylated chalcones                          | Anti-A β aggregation + anti-ferroptotic  |\\n| HLA20A                                          | ACh-I + IC                               |\\n| Tacrine-(hydroxybenzoyl-pyridone) hybrids       | ACh-I + IC                               |\\n| Tacrine-deferiprone                             | ACh-I + IC                               |\\n| Dihydropyrimidinone-derived selenoesters        | ACh-I + IC + anti-oxidant                |\\n| Quinazoline-pyrido-benzorufan-based compounds   | ACh-I + IC                               |\\n| 3,4-HP-based compounds                          | Anti-A β aggregation + ACh-I + IC        |\\n| Benzothiazone-based compounds                   | Anti-A β aggregation + ACh-I + IC        |\\n| Coumarin-quinoline hybrids                      | ACh-I + IC                               |\\n| 1-Phenyl-3-hydroxyl-4-pyridinone derivatives II | Anti-A β aggregation + IC + anti-oxidant |\\n| Cu (atsm) PBPT                                  | Anti-ferroptotic ACh-I + CI              |\\n\\nMAO-I = monoamine oxidase inhibitor; IC = iron chelator; ACh-I = acetylcholinesterase inhibitor\\n\\ninhibition and iron-chelating properties [177, 178]. Similarly, multifunctional iron chelators with anti-A β -aggregating and acetylcholinesterase-inhibiting activity have been developed from 3-hydroxyl-4-pyridinone (3,4-HP) and benzothiazole molecular moieties [179].\\n\\nCircumin has been proposed as an AD therapeutic in light of its iron-binding capability [180]. A number of derivatives have been developed, including coumarin-quinoline hybrids with acetylcholinesterase and iron chelation activity [181] and hybrids of hydroxypyridinone and coumarin, which ameliorated cognitive dysfunction in scopolamine-induced AD mice [182].\\n\\nNovel 1-phenyl-3-hydroxyl-4-pyridinone derivatives with iron-binding capabilities have been synthesized as potential AD therapeutics by incorporating the 3-hydroxy-4pyridinone moiety from deferiprone into the scaffold of H3 receptor antagonists. Some of these combine iron chelating, amyloidβ aggregation inhibition, metal chelating, and free radical scavenging actions [183].\\n\\nChelators based on Schiff bases, particularly hydrazones and thiosemicarbazones, also have potential in neurodegenerative diseases based on their ability to suppress oxidative stress caused by redox-active metals and metal-induced aggregation of amyloid beta [139]. Cholyl hydrazones have been shown to can reduce amyloidβ toxicity and oxidative stress in cell lines [139]. Diacetyl-bis(4-methyl-3t h i o s e m i c a r b a z o n a t o ) c o p p e r I I ( Cu I I ( a t s m ) ) i s a bisthiosemicarbazone that protects against lipid peroxidation and ferroptotic lethality in vitro [184]. Cu II (atsm) is orally bioavailable and crosses the blood -brain barrier [184]. Phase I trials in Parkinson ' s and motor neuron diseases have recently been completed with promising results [185, 186]. Cu II GTSM lowered A β levels and phosphorylated tau levels in cell culture and APP/PS1 transgenic mice [187].\\n\\nMultifunctional hybrids based on hydrazones and thiosemicarbazones are in development. This includes novel adamantine-based semicarbazones and hydrazones [188] and hybrid molecules containing a metal binding unit, a thiosemicarbazone, and acetylcholinesterase inhibitor such as PBPT (pyridoxal 4N -(1-benzylpiperidin-4yl)thiosemicarbazone) [189].\\n\\nVery few iron chelators have made it to clinical trials in humans in spite of the development of the above and other compounds. A search of clinicaltrials.gov using the terms ' iron ' and ' Alzheimer ' s ' on 24 June 2020 only yielded the 3D study discussed above.\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAn extensive body of data in support of a role of iron in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer ' s disease is emerging. This work ties in with the pathology of amyloidβ and tau at many levels. Cell line and animal studies of iron chelators for AD show encouraging results. In spite of this, there has been very little work on iron-lowering strategies in humans with AD, likely due to an overemphasis on amyloid-lowering strategies which have been overwhelmingly disappointing to date. Given the growing number of iron-chelating compounds with potential disease-modifying efficacy, and the availability of MRI and CSF biomarkers of iron load, there is considerable scope to explore this therapeutic class in AD.\\n\\nAcknowledgments: Dr. Gleason is supported by scholarships from the Dementia Centre for Research Collaboration and the Yuligbar Foundation.\\n\\nRequired Author Forms Disclosure forms provided by the authors are available with the online version of this article.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1.

In AD patients, memory loss is accompanied by the formation of beta-amyloid plaques and the appearance of tau in a pathological form. Given the lack of e /uniFB00 ective treatments for AD, the development of new management strategies for these patients is critical. The continued failure to /uniFB01 nd e /uniFB00 ective therapies using molecules aimed at addressing the anti-beta amyloid pathology has led researchers to focus on other non-amyloid-based approaches to restore memory function. Promising non-amyloid related candidate targets include phosphosdiesterases (PDEs), and indeed, Rolipram, a speci /uniFB01 c PDE4 inhibitor, was the /uniFB01 rst compound found to e /uniFB00 ectively restore cognitive de /uniFB01 cits in animal models of AD. More recently, PDE5 inhibitors have also been shown to e /uniFB00 ectively restore memory function. Accordingly, inhibitors of other members of the PDE family may also improve memory performance in AD and non-AD animal models.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n5'GMP\\n\\nHence, in this review, we will summarize the data supporting the use of PDE inhibitors as cognitive enhancers and we will discuss the possible mechanisms of action underlying these e /uniFB00 ects. We shall also adopt a medicinal chemistry perspective that leads us to propose the most promising PDE candidates on the basis of inhibitor selectivity, brain distribution, and mechanism of action.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: Clinical trial, cGMP, mild cognitive impairment, pCREB, GSK3, PKG, p-tau, sildena /uniFB01 l, tadala /uniFB01 l\\n\\nA signi /uniFB01 cant number of people develop cognitive impairments with increasing age. Mild cognitive impairment is characterized by problems that a /uniFB00 ect memory, language or other essential cognitive functions, but that do not interfere with an individual ' s daily life. Dementia is characterized by the progressive global deterioration of cognitive abilities, including memory and other intellectual functions, to an extent that does interfere with daily life. Alzheimer ' s disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia among older people. Clinically, AD is characterized by the presence of extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neuro /uniFB01 brillary tangles in the brain, structures that provoke neuronal dysfunction and cell death.\\n\\nThe increasing number of AD patients associated with the aging of the population makes the development of new disease management/treatment strategies critical. The search for e /uniFB00 ective AD management has been largely based on the amyloid (A β ) hypothesis, mainly focusing on reducing the number of senile plaques, although with little success to date. There is a growing belief that current approaches in AD treatment begin far too late to signi /uniFB01 cantly slow down the progress of the disease or to delay the onset of the most severe symptoms. Indeed, the continued failure of these therapies suggests that new approaches must consider alternative, nonamyloid strategies, to restore memory function.\\n\\nInterestingly, speci /uniFB01 c phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors have been shown to improve memory performance in di /uniFB00 erent animal models of AD. PDE inhibitors regulate signaling pathways by elevating levels of cAMP and/or cGMP, which\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nmay ultimately promote gene transcription by activating the cAMP response element-binding (CREB). 1,2 CREB-dependent gene expression underlies long-term memory formation and persistent long-term potentiation (LTP), which are indicators of synaptic plasticity and strength. 3,4 In the hippocampus, this probably occurs through the formation of new synaptic connections. 5,6 In AD, memory impairment appears to signi /uniFB01 cantly precede the death of nerve cells, implying that neuronal dysfunction may be responsible for the pathophysiology of early stage AD. Thus, by activating the CREB signaling pathway, PDE inhibitors may ameliorate AD symptoms by restoring synaptic function. Moreover, other CREB-independent mechanisms seem to act in synergy to restore cognitive impairment in AD.\\n\\n## 1. PDES IN THE RODENT AND HUMAN BRAIN\\n\\nThe cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a group of enzymes that control the rate of hydrolysis of cAMP and cGMP. Hence, these enzymes are important regulators of the signals mediated by these second messenger molecules. Eleven di /uniFB00 erent PDE families (PDE1 -PDE11) have been described, each typically comprising multiple isoforms and\\n\\nSpecial Issue:\\n\\nAlzheimer's Disease\\n\\nReceived:\\n\\nJuly 11, 2012\\n\\nAccepted:\\n\\nOctober 1, 2012\\n\\nPublished:\\n\\nOctober 1, 2012\\n\\nsplice variants, leading to a total of more than 100 proteins. 7 One key question that arises is whether the di /uniFB00 erent PDE variants play speci /uniFB01 c roles in distinct physiological and pathological processes. To determine the speci /uniFB01 c function of these isoforms in the central nervous system (CNS), several studies have quanti /uniFB01 ed the mRNA or protein of di /uniFB00 erent PDE isoforms in the brain. 8,9 The regional distribution of these isoforms suggests that these enzymes play an important role in neurons, regulating intracellular signaling cascades triggered by neurotransmitters that bind to speci /uniFB01 c cell surface receptors. Their mechanism of action is straightforward, as they control the intracellular concentration of the two aforementioned second messengers, cAMP and/or cGMP. In fact, classi /uniFB01 cation of PDEs is largely based on substrate speci /uniFB01 city (cAMP, cGMP, or dual: see Figure 1). Although most PDE isoforms are\\n\\nFigure 1.

For example, PDE5 and PDE1 are localized in the cerebellum but only in Purkinje neurons, while PDE1B is localized in speci /uniFB01 c subsets of Purkinje cells. 10\\n\\nPDE6 has not been detected in the CNS, as its expression is restricted to the retina and pineal gland. 7 In contrast to other PDEs, neither PDE6 nor PDE3 appears to play a signi /uniFB01 cant role in neural function and each is expressed at low levels in the CNS. 8,11 Although PDE3 was thought to be present at low levels in the CNS, inhibitors of this PDE activate the CREB signaling pathway in the brain (see below) and recent evidence suggests that PDE3B is expressed in proopiomelanocortin and neuropeptide Y neurons in the mouse hypothalamus. 12\\n\\nThree subtypes of PDE1 have been described that exhibit comparable distribution patterns in the CNS: 1A, 1B, and 1C. The areas in which these subtypes have been analyzed included the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, thalamus, and striatum, with particularly high levels of PDE1B in the caudate nucleus and the nucleus accumbens. 8,13 The expression of PDE1 in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex suggests that this enzyme may play a role in memory formation and storage. Indeed, the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine has bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ects on cognitive function in rats with streptozotocin-induced learning and memory impairments, 14 and in animal models of mental retardation. 15\\n\\nSeveral studies of murine and/or human brain tissue have demonstrated that PDE2A is widely expressed in the brain, with the strongest expression in the cortex, striatum, and hippocampus. 8,11,16 -18 The expression of PDE2A in the hippocampus suggests a role in memory formation, which has been demonstrated in vivo through the e /uniFB00 ects of speci /uniFB01 c PDE2 inhibitors in di /uniFB00 erent memory tasks. 19,20\\n\\nPDE4 is widely expressed in the CNS 21 -24 and there are four genes (PDE4A, 4B, 4C, and 4D) that encode over 20 di /uniFB00 erent variants of this enzyme. 25 The exact role of PDE4 in higher neural functions remains unknown but the development of selective inhibitors led PDE4 to be considered as a therapeutic target for diseases that cause cognitive impairment (reviewed in ref 26).\\n\\nSeveral discrepancies have arisen regarding the presence of PDE5 in the rodent and primate CNS. While some authors have suggested that PDE5 is not detectable in the human brain, 17 others detected PDE5 mRNA in the human cortex, hippocampus, and striatum through techniques that included Northern blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction. 8,27 While high levels of PDE5 have been found in mouse Purkinje neurons, 10 the levels of PDE5 mRNA in the hippocampus and cortex of the human brain appear to be very low relative to those of other PDEs, such as PDE2. 8 The distribution of PDE5 in the CNS has been recently reassessed given the improvements reported in memory performance following treatment with PDE5 inhibitors both in wild type animals 28,29 and in animal models of AD. 30 -32 In situ hybridization revealed the expression of PDE5 mRNA in several areas of the mouse and primate brain, including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. In the hippocampus, PDE5 transcripts are expressed in the pyramidal cell layers of CA1, CA3 and in the granule cells of the dentate gyrus. These data suggest an important role of this PDE in neural activity related to cognition, supporting the hypothesis that PDE5 inhibitors a /uniFB00 ect memory-related processes. 32\\n\\nTwo genes encode PDE7, PDE7A, and PDE7B, each giving rise to several splice variants of which PDE7A1 and PDE7B2 are found in the brain. 7 While low levels of PDE7A mRNA are detected in several brain areas, including the hippocampus, cortex, and striatum, 8,33 PDE7B expression in the CNS is stronger than that found in other tissues. Regions expressing high levels of PDE7B include the caudate nucleus, the nucleus accumbens, the cortex, and the hippocampus. 8 Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of PDE7 has been proposed to protect against in /uniFB02 ammation caused by neuronal death following spinal cord injury. 34\\n\\nThe PDE8 family is also coded by two genes, PDE8A and PDE8B, whose protein products are speci /uniFB01 c for cAMP. PDE8A is ubiquitous, while the expression of PDE8B is restricted to the brain and thyroid. 7 The highest levels of PDE8 in the brain are found in caudate, cortex, and hippocampus. To date, no data regarding the e /uniFB00 ects of PDE8 inhibitors have been reported.\\n\\nMembers of the PDE9 family appear to show the highest a /uniFB03 nity for cGMP. Only one gene for this PDE has been identi /uniFB01 ed (PDE9A), although multiple mRNA variants are expressed. 7 Although widely expressed in a variety of tissues, high levels of this isoform are detected in the brain, 8,35 particularly in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum and the caudate nucleus. 8 Based on the relatively high levels in the CNS, it has been have suggested that this enzyme may be an important regulator of cGMP signaling in the brain. 35 Moreover, in several animals models, bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ects of PDE9 inhibitors have been reported on cognitive function,\\n\\nwhich appear to be mediated by increased levels of this second messenger. 36\\n\\nOnly one gene (PDE10A) has been identi /uniFB01 ed for PDE10, although four variants may be generated. 7 PDE10 transcripts are present in a number of brain areas (cerebellum, thalamus, hippocampus, striatum, and spinal cord 8,37 -39 ), and since the strongest expression is in the caudate nucleus, they may ful /uniFB01 ll a speci /uniFB01 c role in striatal function. 40 In fact, speci /uniFB01 c inhibitors of PDE10 are currently being developed to treat Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. 41 In addition, decreased PDE10 mRNA and protein levels have been described in the striatum of patients of Huntington's disease. 42 Based on its localization in the hippocampus and the increases in PDE10A after LTP induction, 43 a role for this protein in memory and cognition has also been proposed. This PDE may represent an important target to treat cognitive de /uniFB01 cits associated to schizophrenia. 44\\n\\nThe PDE11 family contains one identi /uniFB01 ed gene (PDE11A), which encodes one of the less abundant PDEs in the tissues analyzed. 8 Although low levels of PDE11A have been described in the cortex, caudate nucleus, nucleus accumbens, cerebellum and hippocampus, 8 a recent study demonstrated that PDE11A is enriched in the ventral hippocampus, and that its deletion induces psychiatric disease-related phenotypes. 45\\n\\nIn conclusion, many members of the PDE family are present in the CNS, particularly in areas implicated in learning and memory processes. As these enzymes control the concentration of two second messengers that are crucial for neural function, PDE inhibitors represent promising candidate drugs for the treatment of altered cognition states.\\n\\n## 2. COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT BY PDE INHIBITORS IN ANIMAL MODELS\\n\\nSeveral selective PDE inhibitors have been shown to improve learning in rodent models of cognition. Both cAMP and cGMP are important second messengers in the mature brain that are directly involved in time-dependent events of memory consolidation. 46 Activation of the cAMP-PKA pathway cascade triggers the activation of transcription factors such as CREB, inducing the gene transcription required to consolidate learning and memory. 47,48 Moreover, recent /uniFB01 ndings have also linked the cGMP pathway to cognition. Basal levels of cGMP are higher in the newborn brain than in the adult brain, and they decrease with age, a decline thought to be the consequence of increased expression of cGMP-dependent PDEs. 49 Inhibition of PDEs that speci /uniFB01 cally mediate the hydrolysis of cGMP in the brain (mainly isoforms 2, 5, and 9) results in increases in the levels of this cyclic nucleotide, which in turn may prevent the onset of senile dementia. 50 In addition to inhibitors of PDE2, PDE5, and PDE9, which are speci /uniFB01 c for cGMP, inhibitors of the cAMP-speci /uniFB01 c PDEs (PDE1, PDE4, and PDE10) have been shown to boost memory in certain animal models. 9\\n\\nVinpocetine is a speci /uniFB01 c PDE1 inhibitor that has been tested as a memory enhancer, and it has been found to facilitate LTP, 51 improve memory retrieval in passive avoidance in rats, 52 and enhance cognitive performance in humans. 53 Recent studies demonstrated that vinpocetine also improves synaptic plasticity in a model of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders, where there is impaired cortical development and sensory function. 15,54\\n\\nThe e /uniFB00 ect of PDE2 inhibitors on memory has been tested using the selective inhibitor, Bay 60-7550, which improves memory in young and aged rats when administered at speci /uniFB01 c time points (1 h before and 3 h after the /uniFB01 rst trial in the object recognition test 46 ). Similarly, Bay 60-7550 reverses NMDA antagonist-induced memory de /uniFB01 cits in mice and attenuates memory de /uniFB01 cits caused by acute tryptophan depletion in rats. 19,20,46,55,56 These results suggest that inhibition of PDE2 augments neuronal cGMP levels under conditions of guanylate cyclase stimulation. 19\\n\\nThe di /uniFB00 erential distribution of the four PDE4 subtypes (PDE4A-D) in the brain 57 re /uniFB02 ects their distinct roles in the CNS, which may be attributed to the regulation of cAMP/ CREB signaling. Based on its predominant expression in hippocampal CA1, 57 PDE4D appears to be the main subtype involved in mediating memory consolidation and LTP. 58,59 Indeed, mice lacking PDE4D display enhanced long-term hippocampal-dependent memory. Furthermore, the inhibition of PDE4 by rolipram in PDE4D-de /uniFB01 cient mice did not alter memory, indicating a key role of PDE4D in memory processes. However, it should be noted that mice lacking PDE4B do not exhibit altered cognition in acquisition and consolidation processes, 60,61 although they do display impaired reversal learning. 62 The cognitive e /uniFB00 ects of PDE4 inhibitors, primarily the prototypic PDE4 inhibitor rolipram, have been widely studied. Rolipram has bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ects on hippocampaldependent memory tasks, such as the object recognition task, as well as on passive avoidance learning and in fear conditioning memory paradigms. 63 -65 In addition, positive e /uniFB00 ects on prefrontal cortex-dependent memory in young rats and monkeys have also been reported. 66 Interestingly, opposite e /uniFB00 ects of rolipram have been described in rat and monkey models of aging, which may re /uniFB02 ect the di /uniFB00 erential PKA regulation in the CNS of di /uniFB00 erent species. 66 Other bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ects of rolipram on memory have been demonstrated in animals with memory de /uniFB01 cits induced by a number of manipulations. 59,65,67 -71 Yet despite these /uniFB01 ndings, the use of rolipram to treat cognitive-related chronic disease in humans is limited by its side e /uniFB00 ects, which include nausea and headaches. Another PDE4 inhibitor, MK 0952, enhances cognition in preclinical studies, 72 which prompted a clinical trial in patients with mild-to-moderate Alzheimer ' s disease. 73 To the best of our knowledge, a phase II study has been completed, although no results have yet been released. Associated side e /uniFB00 ects represent a major drawback to the use of PDE4 inhibitors as memory enhancers, and they include emesis, 74 which appears to be PDE4D-dependent. 75 However, 3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxybenzaldehyde (GEBR-7b), a recently developed novel and selective PDE4D inhibitor, is 3 -10 times more potent as a memory enhancer than rolipram, and it can exert these e /uniFB00 ects at doses that do not produce emesis-like symptoms in rodents. 76 Inhibition of brain PDE4 without emetic side e /uniFB00 ects may also be achieved by allosteric modulation (see section 8). It should be however noted that it is not entirely clear whether PDE4 inhibition alone is the sole basis of emesis. For instance, the emetic in the ferret cannot be explained by PDE4D selectivity or di /uniFB00 erences in PDE4D inhibitor potency (see Spina for details). 77\\n\\nSelective PDE5 inhibitors, such as sildena /uniFB01 l, tadala /uniFB01 l, and vardena /uniFB01 l, are currently used for erectile dysfunction and for chronic human pulmonary hypertension. In the past decade, evidence has accumulated that suggests bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ects of PDE5 inhibitors in cognition, both in physiological and pathological conditions (see below). Memory enhancement following sildena /uniFB01 l treatment has been demonstrated in a variety of behavioral paradigms, both in rodents and primates. 58,78 -83 In a one-trial learning paradigm (object\\n\\nrecognition and passive avoidance), sildena /uniFB01 l improved early consolidation processes (less than 3 h), but no e /uniFB00 ect was observed when the drug was administered before or 3 h after training, indicating that sildena /uniFB01 l has no e /uniFB00 ect on acquisition and late consolidation processes. A recent study demonstrated that sildena /uniFB01 l improves spatial memory in the Morris Water Maze (MWM) test when administered after the last training trial on each day of the acquisition phase of the test. 84 In addition to its e /uniFB00 ects on hippocampal-dependent memory, sildena /uniFB01 l improves performance of a prefrontal-cortex-dependent cognition test in monkeys, 58 and attenuates memory impairment induced by nitric oxide synthase inhibition, 55,80 hyperammonemia, 81 blockade of muscarinic cholinergic receptors, 85 diabetes conditions, and electroconvulsive shock. 86\\n\\nIn addition to PDE5, PDE6 and PDE9 are speci /uniFB01 c for cGMP, with the latter exhibiting the greatest a /uniFB03 nity for cGMP ( K m = 170 nM), 87 highlighting its importance in the regulation of cGMP downstream signaling pathways. Two selective PDE9 inhibitors have been developed and tested in higher-function tasks, BAY73-6691 and PF-04447943. Interestingly, these compounds behave as enhancers of memory and synaptic plasticity, reversing memory de /uniFB01 cits and attenuating forgetting. 36,88,89 BAY73-6691 appears to be more e /uniFB00 ective in facilitating LTP in hippocampal slices from aged versus young rats, while PF-04447943 attenuates the loss of hippocampal spine density in the Tg2576 AD model, and it is currently under clinical development for the treatment of AD. 90 Indeed, a phase 2 clinical trial has been completed, although no results have yet been disclosed (P /uniFB01 zer, 2009; ClinicalTrials.gov Identi /uniFB01 er: NCT00930059).\\n\\nRecently, PDE10 inhibitors have attracted interest for the treatment of CNS disorders, particularly schizophrenia 44 and Huntington's disease. 91 The expression of PDE10 in the striatum suggests that this protein may be more closely involved in striatal functions than those controlled by the hippocampus or prefrontal cortex. 42,92 Papaverine, a selective PDE10 inhibitor, impairs memory in rats when administered by the intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) route both before and after learning. 93 By contrast, in rats treated with the NMDA receptor antagonist phencyclidine (PCP), PDE10 inhibitors improve information processing and attention. 41 In general, behavioral de /uniFB01 cits in papaverine-treated mice resemble those of PDE10A de /uniFB01 cient mice, 94 probably re /uniFB02 ecting striatal cell activation. 91,95\\n\\nIn summary, cGMP and/or cAMP signaling pathways appear to play an important role in the processes underlying learning and memory. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that the bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ects of rolipram and sildena /uniFB01 l on spatial memory are reversed to control levels by hippocampal inhibition of PKA and PKG, respectively. 84 Moreover, increases in either cAMP or cGMP may promote CREB phosphorylation (see section 5), a key factor in regulating the expression of plasticity-associated genes (i.e., genes that trigger long-lasting changes in synaptic plasticity). 48,96,97 Since cGMP/cAMP have vasodilator e /uniFB00 ects, increased blood /uniFB02 ow and glucose metabolism may also contribute to the e /uniFB00 ects of PDE inhibitors on memory. 98,99\\n\\n## 3. PDE INHIBITORS IN THE TREATMENT OF ALZHEIMER ' S DISEASE\\n\\nTo evaluate the therapeutic value of PDEs in AD, it is important to determine the expression of the di /uniFB00 erent enzymes in the human brain, both in normal and pathological conditions. In situ hybridization has demonstrated marked region-speci /uniFB01 c alterations in the expression of PDE7 and PDE8\\n\\nin AD. 100 While PDE7B mRNA expression remains unchanged, PDE7A transcripts are reduced and PDE8B mRNA levels increase in hippocampal regions in advanced stages of AD. 100 A more recent study failed to report a change in the expression of two cGMP PDEs (PDE2 and PDE9) in AD brain samples. 17 Moreover, expression of all but one of the PDE4 isoforms is reduced or unchanged in AD brains. 101 Interestingly, expression of a short isoform, PDE4D1, augments in AD, suggesting that this isoform may represent a speci /uniFB01 c target to enhance memory consolidation in AD patients. 101 However, further studies are required to determine whether these changes in PDE expression are a cause or consequence of AD.\\n\\nOver a decade ago, one of the /uniFB01 rst studies investigating the e /uniFB00 ects of PDE inhibitors in AD in humans reported a negative outcome, demonstrating that the PDE1 inhibitor vinpocetine failed to improve cognition or slow the rate of decline in AD patients. 102 However, more recent studies in the search for drugs that may alleviate or reverse AD symptoms have con /uniFB01 rmed PDE inhibitors to be promising therapeutic tools. The e /uniFB00 ectiveness of repeated administration of PDE3 (cilostazol), PDE4 (rolipram), or PDE5 (sildena /uniFB01 l or tadala /uniFB01 l) inhibitors has been demonstrated in several mouse models of AD. 30 -32,103 -105 As each of these models harbors distinct genetic alterations, the potential of PDE inhibitors in the treatment of AD is high indeed, although the underlying mechanism remains to be fully elucidated (see section 5).\\n\\n## 4. PDES AND PDE INHIBITORS IN MOUSE MODELS OF ALZHEIMER ' S DISEASE\\n\\nCilostazol is a PDE3 inhibitor that is used as an antiplatelet agent in the treatment of subcortical vascular disease. This drug increases cAMP levels, probably by promoting the phosphorylation of CREB, 60 which is known to play a crucial role in memory enhancement and synaptic plasticity. 3,5 Cilostazol also increases cerebral blood /uniFB02 ow and exerts antioxidative e /uniFB00 ects. Based on these properties, this compound has been tested in mice treated with A β 25 -35, and it was shown that repeated cilostazol administration protected against memory impairments in these mice by preventing A β aggregation and the accumulation of oxidative stressors. 104\\n\\nOn the basis of preliminary data indicating that rolipram reverses A β 42-induced impairment of LTP in the CA1 hippocampal region, the e /uniFB00 ects of this drug were also tested in a mouse model of AD. Activation of the cAMP/CREB pathway induced by PDE4 inhibition promoted a long lasting reversal of memory impairments in APP/PS1 mice. The compound led to synaptic remodeling, but that had no e /uniFB00 ect on A β production or deposition. 103,106\\n\\nThe PDE5 inhibitor sildena /uniFB01 l exerts potent anti-AD e /uniFB00 ects when administered at advanced stages of the disease in di /uniFB00 erent mouse models of AD, resulting in the reversal of cognitive impairment. 30 -32 However, the underlying mechanism of action remains unclear, with several studies reporting con /uniFB02 icting /uniFB01 ndings. In APP/PS1 AD mice, decreased A β levels were described after 3 weeks of sildena /uniFB01 l treatment, while no changes in amyloid burden were reported in the J20 mouse model. 30 -32 These di /uniFB00 erences may re /uniFB02 ect the mouse model used and/or the dose or duration of treatment. Another PDE5 inhibitor, tadala /uniFB01 l, was also reported recently to improve spatial memory in the J20 mouse model of AD, providing a greater bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ect than that observed with comparable doses of sildena /uniFB01 l. 32 The longer half-life and proven safety of tadala /uniFB01 l when administered chronically for the treatment of erectile\\n\\ndysfunction and pulmonary arterial hypertension 107,108 suggest that this drug may be a promising candidate for AD pharmacotherapy.\\n\\nIn conclusion, PDE inhibitors have demonstrated promising e /uniFB00 ects in animal models of AD, which will soon be investigated in clinical trials. The proven safety of several PDE inhibitors already in clinical use (often administered chronically) has created high expectations regarding their use for the treatment of AD.\\n\\n## 5. PDE INHIBITION AND COGNITIVE ENHANCEMENT IN HUMANS\\n\\nA pioneering double-blind crossover study of 10 neurologically healthy young male volunteers investigated the e /uniFB00 ects of an acute oral dose of 100 mg sildena /uniFB01 l on auditory attention and word recognition tasks, as determined by behavioral pattern analysis and electrophysiological recordings. 109 Sildena /uniFB01 ltreated individuals exhibited even-related potentials in auditory tasks, indicating an enhanced ability to focus attention and select relevant target stimuli. In the memory task, the CNS e /uniFB00 ects of sildena /uniFB01 l were re /uniFB02 ected by a reduction in negativity, a neurophysiological index of the detection of a change in the acoustic environment that can be elicited in the absence of focused attention. 110 Taken together, these results provided evidence that PDE5 inhibitors can regulate cognition events in the human CNS.\\n\\nVarious PDE5 inhibitors are currently marketed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction and of pulmonary arterial hypertension, the most common of which are sildena /uniFB01 l, tadala /uniFB01 l, and vardena /uniFB01 l. These drugs are safe even when administered as prolonged treatments. 111 PDE inhibitors are also used o /uniFB00 -label to treat altitude sickness. The Wilderness Medical Society 112 recommends tadala /uniFB01 l (10 mg twice a day) or sildena /uniFB01 l (50 mg every 8 h) to prevent high altitude pulmonary edema. The safety of PDE5 inhibitors and their demonstrated bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ects in AD animal models prompted a study in patients diagnosed with erectile dysfunction whose cognitive status was tested before and after treatment with udena /uniFB01 l, a recently developed PDE5 inhibitor. 113 Udena /uniFB01 l is marketed as Zydena by the Korean Dong-A pharmaceutical company, but it has not yet been approved by the United States Federal Drug Administration or by the European Medicines Agency. Zydena ' s market is thus Asia-Paci /uniFB01 c and Russia.\\n\\nIn 27 patients with erectile dysfunction due to psychogenic, organic, or mixed causes, and with average illness duration of 33 months, erectile dysfunction was scored in parallel with cognitive function. The Seoul verbal learning test, and the Korean versions of the mini-mental state examination and the frontal assessment battery, were performed before and 2 months after drug administration. Although the patients were not fully diagnosed from a neurological point of view, no neurological or neuropsychiatric pathologies were detected among comorbid conditions, which included diabetes, hypertension, and/or hyperlipidemia. Average mini-mental and frontal assessment scores increased signi /uniFB01 cantly after udena /uniFB01 l administration ( p &lt; 0.001). By contrast, the improvement in the Seoul learning test was not signi /uniFB01 cant ( p &gt; 0.05), probably due to the already high pro /uniFB01 ciency of the subjects and the absence of any underlying episodic-memory- or learning-related pathologies. Although this was a nonrandomized study of a small number of patients, and there was no placebo group, the improvement in cognitive scores observed after PDE inhibitor administration paves the way for further randomized and placebo-controlled clinical trials to study the e /uniFB00 ects of udena /uniFB01 l, and other PDE5 inhibitors approved for use in humans, in patients with cognitive de /uniFB01 cits.\\n\\nAs mentioned above, two phase 2 clinical trials have been carried out to determine the e /uniFB00 ects of a PDE4 inhibitor (MK 0952; ClinicalTrials.gov identi /uniFB01 er: NCT00362024) and a PDE9 inhibitor (PF-04447943; ClinicalTrials.gov identi /uniFB01 er: NCT00930059) in AD, although no results have yet been disclosed. However, a recent pilot study reported that the PDE 3 inhibitor cilostazol prevents cognitive decline in patients with AD. 114 A phase 4 clinical trial is currently recruiting participants to analyze the e /uniFB00 ects of cilostazol in patients with mild to moderate AD who have been prescribed donepezil for subcortical white matter hyperintensities (WMHI) (ClinicalTrials.gov identi /uniFB01 er: NCT01409564, phase 4). The next decade will be crucial to determine the e /uniFB03 cacy of PDE inhibitors for cognitive enhancement and/or neuroprotective therapies in humans.\\n\\n## 6. PDE INHIBITORS IN ALZHEIMER ' S DISEASE: MECHANISM OF ACTION\\n\\nAlmost all PDE isoforms have been implicated in mood and/or cognitive disorders, 115 and inhibitors of all isoforms have been patented as potential AD pharmacotherapies (Patent: US 20120076732). Increases in cAMP and/or cGMP levels represent the most reliable end points of the activity of PDE inhibitors. In principle, the e /uniFB00 ects of PDE inhibitors on cognition or the pathophysiological mechanisms of AD are mediated by increases in the levels of these cyclic nucleotides in the endothelial cells of brain vessels and/or neurons. For example, PDE5 inhibitors trigger vasodilation, and PDE5A mRNA and protein is present in human middle cerebral arteries. 116 As PDE5 is critical to control the diameter of vessels and its inhibition promotes vasodilation, these data suggest that some of the actions of PDE5 inhibitors may be a consequence of increased cerebral blood /uniFB02 ow. However, neither cerebral excitability nor hemodynamic responses are a /uniFB00 ected by the PDE5 inhibitor sildena /uniFB01 l in healthy subjects. 117 Moreover, no associations between cerebrovascular risk factors and perfusion scores have been reported for sildena /uniFB01 l, except in stroke patients. Interestingly, in such stroke patients, there were signi /uniFB01 cantly more brain areas with diminished (not augmented) perfusion after sildena /uniFB01 l administration, 118 which may be due to the central actions of PDE inhibitors inhibiting the enzyme in peripheral cells. Indeed, a recent study reported that anandamide, an endogenous cannabinoid, suppresses pain initiation via a peripheral mechanism. 119 Also, the antidepressant e /uniFB03 cacy of ginseng saponins appears to be attributable to its peripheral anti-in /uniFB02 ammatory activity. 120 A recent study reported that PDE5 inhibitors improve novel object recognition in rats with cognitive de /uniFB01 cits induced by scopolamine, or by an N -methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that speci /uniFB01 cally disrupts short-term memory (STM) and attention processes. 121 Based on these /uniFB01 ndings, the cerebrovasculature was proposed as a locus for the peripheral e /uniFB00 ect of PDE5 inhibition in the object recognition test.\\n\\nWhile the peripheral activity of PDE inhibitors may have an impact on the CNS, many of these compounds cross the bloodbrain barrier and reach concentrations high enough to inhibit PDEs in neurons and glial cells. At doses normally administered in animal models of AD, tadala /uniFB01 l may be present in low micromolar concentrations in the brain, su /uniFB03 cient to inhibit both PDE5 and PDE11. 32 In another transgenic rodent line, the\\n\\nFlinders sensitive rat model of depression, sildena /uniFB01 l administration results in hippocampal and cortical concentrations of 146 and 185 nM, su /uniFB03 cient to inhibit PDE5. 122 Thus, the main mechanism of action of PDE inhibitors probably involves increased levels of cAMP and/or cGMP in cells within the CNS. In addition to replenishing the low levels of cyclic nucleotides present in the aged brain, 49,50,55 this e /uniFB00 ect leads to sustained and/or increased activation of signaling pathways that impact neuroprotection/neurodegeneration processes.\\n\\nCREB is a cellular transcription factor that binds to speci /uniFB01 c DNA sequences known as cAMP response elements (CRE), thereby modifying the transcription of downstream genes involved in neural plasticity and neuroprotection. 123 Rolipram inhibits the high-a /uniFB03 nity, cAMP-speci /uniFB01 c PDE4, and it was the /uniFB01 rst PDE inhibitor tested in an animal model of AD, improving synaptic and cognitive functions in the double transgenic APP/ PS1. 103 Further studies with rolipram 124 and cilostazol, a PDE3 inhibitor, 104,105 linked their e /uniFB03 cacy to the pCREB-mediated reversal of amyloid-beta-induced cognitive de /uniFB01 cits. Furthermore, chronic rolipram administration reverses A β -induced alterations in pCREB expression in the hippocampus of rats that received intracerebroventricular injections of A β peptides, which in turn induced memory de /uniFB01 cits. 124\\n\\nWithin cells, cGMP and cAMP act through di /uniFB00 erent pathways to induce CREB phosphorylation during LTP induction. 125 Speci /uniFB01 cally, the e /uniFB00 ects of cGMP and PKG appear to be indirectly due to increases in intracellular Ca 2+ levels. Thus, cGMP activates PKG and ADP-ribosyl cyclase, stimulating the production of cADP-ribose, which acts synergistically with cytoplasmic Ca 2+ to further promote Ca 2+ release from a variety of sources. 126 -130 When the Ca 2+ signal is su /uniFB03 ciently large, it triggers CREB phosphorylation and induces of LTP in parallel with PKA. Therefore, cGMP mimics the bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ects of cAMP on pCREB, although it may reverse cognitive impairment via other more speci /uniFB01 c pathways.\\n\\nPDE5 is 100-fold more selective for cGMP than cAMP: the K m for cGMP is in the low micromolar range, while that of cAMP is ∼ 300 μ M. Sildena /uniFB01 l inhibits PDE5 and to a lesser extent PDE6 and PDE1, 7 and its inhibition of PDE5 counteracts the negative e /uniFB00 ects of A β on CREB phosphorylation. 31 Pathways speci /uniFB01 c to cGMP have been characterized extensively, particularly since the discovery of NO as a neuroregulatory molecule. Indeed, nitric oxide (NO) activity is primarily mediated via increases in cellular cGMP levels. 131 Two cGMP-dependent kinases are major downstream e /uniFB00 ectors of many signaling events of the NO/cGMP pathway. 132 The canonical NO/cGMP/cGK pathway modulates long-term changes in synaptic activity in the hippocampus, amygdala, cerebellum, and other brain regions, and it contributes to distinct forms of learning and memory, such as fear conditioning, motor adaptation, and object recognition. At the molecular level, cGMP-dependent kinase isoforms appear to mediate the e /uniFB00 ects of cGMP on presynaptic transmitter release and postsynaptic functions, and they have also been proposed to modulate cytoskeletal organization, vesicle and AMPA receptor tra /uniFB03 cking, and gene expression through the phosphorylation of various neural substrates, including VASP, RhoA, RGS2, hSERT, GluR1, G-substrate, and DARPP-32. 97 In AD mouse models, cGMP-dependent inactivation of GSK3 β by PDE5 inhibitors leads to a decrease in hyperphosphorylated tau in the brain areas involved in learning and memory. 30,32 As tau phosphorylation better correlates with cognitive impairment in AD than amyloid burden, 133 increased hippocampal pAkt and pGSK3 β -Ser9 levels have been proposed to underlie the improvements in learning and memory consolidation observed in sildena /uniFB01 land tadala /uniFB01 l-treated AD mice. 30,32 Similar activation of the Akt pathway by tadala /uniFB01 l has been proposed to increase cell survival in di /uniFB00 erent peripheral tissues. 134,135 This association between NO-cGMP signaling and tau phosphorylation via pGSK3 β activity is supported by the existence of a signaling cascade that links cGMP activation with GSK3 inhibition. 136\\n\\n## 7. CHEMICAL PROBES AS PHARMACOLOGICAL TOOLS\\n\\nDrug discovery approaches in AD research are now focusing on aspects of AD pathology other than the amyloid pathology. A promising approach is to reduce aberrant tau phosphorylation, which may be achieved via the NO-cGMP-related pathway. In fact, it is predicted that increases in cerebral cGMP rather than cAMP will be more bene /uniFB01 cial for the treatment of cognitive impairment. Alternative approaches can also increase cAMP, such as drugs that target G-protein-coupled receptors. The best option in PDE-related AD therapy is therefore to target enzymes whose substrate speci /uniFB01 city for cGMP is comparable to or greater than that for cAMP (e.g., PDEs 1C, 2A, 5, 6, 9, and 11). Many of these PDEs are present in the CNS (see section 2), and they therefore constitute potential targets for anti-AD drugs. However, there are exceptions that include PDE6, whose expression appears to be restricted to the retina and pineal gland, and PDE11, that has yet to be reported in the human CNS. Finally, PDE4 and PDE10A should also be considered as potential targets for cognition enhancement due to their speci /uniFB01 c localization in the CNS, the availability of optimal inhibitors, and the e /uniFB03 cacy of these compounds in models of memory impairment (Table 1).\\n\\nTable 1. Summary of PDEs and Their Corresponding Pharmacological Tools, Which Are Critical for Target and Hypothesis Validation\\n\\n| target   | expressed in brain   | substrate   | pharmacological tool   | cognitive bene /uniFB01 t in ad model   |\\n|----------|----------------------|-------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\\n| PDE1B    | yes                  | cAMP/ cGMP  | 1                      | yes                                     |\\n| PDE2A    | yes                  | cAMP/ cGMP  | 2                      | yes                                     |\\n| PDE4     | yes                  | cAMP        | 3, 4, 5, 6             | yes (only 3 )                           |\\n| PDE5     | yes                  | cGMP        | 7, 8, 9                | yes                                     |\\n| PDE9     | yes                  | cGMP        | 10                     | yes                                     |\\n| PDE10    | yes                  | cAMP/ cGMP  | 11                     | yes (but not using 11 )                 |\\n\\nOne advantage of using inhibitors of dual-speci /uniFB01 city PDEs is that this can promote increases of both cGMP and cAMP in neurons. The ideal inhibitor would be one that increases the levels of both cyclic nucleotides but that primarily targets cGMP. Concomitant increases of cGMP and cAMP are nowadays seen not as detrimental but bene /uniFB01 cial to improve cognition de /uniFB01 cits. Finally, it is important to consider the safety pro /uniFB01 le of PDE5 inhibitors in humans, which is extremely favorable, particularly in the case of tadala /uniFB01 l (Cialis) that is approved for both acute and chronic erectile dysfunction, and for arterial pulmonary hypertension. Tadala /uniFB01 l is administered at doses of 2.5 or 5 mg/day for the treatment of chronic erectile dysfunction and up to 40 mg/day for arterial pulmonary hypertension (marketed as Adcirca). 137,138 Therefore, safety\\n\\nassociated to prolonged treatments of tadala /uniFB01 l is quite notable. In summary, targeting PDEs 1B/C, 2A 5 or 9 represents a promising approach for the chronic treatment of cognitive disorders.\\n\\nCurrently, there are more than 125 entries publicly available in the protein data bank, 139 halo- and apo-forms, covering all known PDE isoforms (except PDE11) and some variants. Together with ligand-based chemogenomics approaches, structural information can be used to attain o /uniFB00 -target selectivity against other isoforms. For example, PDE1B is expressed at high levels in the brain, particularly in the striatum and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, 140 and its inhibition by vinpocetine ( 1 ) induces memory-enhancing e /uniFB00 ects. 51 Accordingly, structural information pertaining to this isoform (PDB: 1TAZ) 139 may help medicinal chemists to design and synthesize novel, and more selective, PDE1B ligands.\\n\\nPDE2A is also expressed in regions associated with cognitive function, including the cortex, striatum, hippocampus, amygdala, and habenula. 141 According to the biochemical and electrophysiological e /uniFB00 ects of the isoform-selective inhibitor Bay 60-7550 ( 2 ), this PDE variant mediates LTP induction by regulating cGMP levels. 19 Moreover, as described above, Bay 60-7550 has cognition enhancing properties in animal models. PDE2 has slightly higher a /uniFB03 nity for cGMP than cAMP, although it may metabolize both cyclic nucleotides in a tissuedependent manner. Indeed, the endogenous substrate of this enzyme may vary across tissues in function of its subcellular localization and/or splice variant expression. Interestingly, most studies of the role of PDE2A in brain tissue point to its modulation of cGMP levels. 141\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Vinpocetine e (1)\\n\\nBay 60-7550 (2)\\n\\nThe PDE4 subfamily of PDEs is quite complex, comprising over 20 splice variants, which permits a variety of regional and subcellular localizations. 7 Among the di /uniFB00 erent isoforms, PDE4A and B are expressed at high levels in the frontal and temporal cortex, and in the hippocampus of humans. 57 Preclinical studies with a selective and brain-penetrant PDE4 inhibitor, rolipram ( 3 ), identi /uniFB01 ed this isoform as a promising target for the treatment of the cognitive dysfunction associated with AD. 142 However, serious side e /uniFB00 ects associated with PDE4 inhibitors have hampered their development. Nevertheless, in 2011, the FDA approved the /uniFB01 rst and only selective PDE4 inhibitor, ro /uniFB02 umilast ( 4 ), to reduce the exacerbation and worsening of symptoms associated with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Given the potential risks identi /uniFB01 ed in clinical trials, ro /uniFB02 umilast was approved with a medication guide informing patients of side e /uniFB00 ects. 143 A recent report highlighted the severity of this drug ' s side e /uniFB00 ects and determined that its bene /uniFB01 ts are minimal at best: ' even a small increase in adverse e /uniFB00 ects would tilt the risk/bene /uniFB01 t ratio against the use of ro /uniFB02 umilast ' . 144 The development of PDE4 inhibitors lacking side e /uniFB00 ects is critical for therapeutic applications that require chronic treatment, such as AD. In addition to the selective PDE4D inhibitor GEBR-7B ( 5 ) (see section 2), 145 DeCode Genetics has used structural information\\n\\n(PDB: 3IAD) 139 to develop a series of PDE4 allosteric modulators that serve as a molecular glue to close a regulatory domain, in this case acting as a ' lid ' over the PDE4 catalytic site. 146 These compounds do not completely abolish PDE4 enzymatic activity in cellular and in vivo models. Interestingly, the occurrence of emesis, a dose-limiting side e /uniFB00 ect of existing active site-directed PDE4 inhibitors, is also signi /uniFB01 cantly reduced by D159687 ( 6 ). 146 This strategy of PDE4 modulation may therefore lead to the development of pharmacotherapeutic compounds in the near future that will ultimately become available to the patient.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nPDE5 mRNA has been detected in the cortex and hippocampus of both mice and primates, con /uniFB01 rming an important role of this enzyme in neural activities related to cognition. 32 The availability of selective, safe, and brainpenetrant PDE5 inhibitors has been crucial to carry out studies in AD animal models to assess cognitive improvements and the biochemical markers underlying such improvement. Vardena /uniFB01 l ( 7 ), 46,121 sildena /uniFB01 l ( 8 ), 30,31 and, more recently, tadala /uniFB01 l ( 9 ) 32 have all been used as pharmacological tools, con /uniFB01 rming their e /uniFB03 cacy in AD mouse models. Given that (i) PDE5 mRNA is expressed in the cortex and hippocampus; 32 (ii) PDE5 inhibitors cross the blood-brain barrier; 32 (iii) PDE5 inhibitors, particularly tadala /uniFB01 l, are safe; and (iv) these drugs exhibit favorable pharmacokinetic parameters for these already marketed drugs, PDE5 inhibitors should soon enter into clinical trials for the treatment of mild cognitive impairment and/or AD. The characteristics of tadala /uniFB01 l are more suited for the chronic treatment of mild cognitive impairment than those of vardena /uniFB01 l or sildena /uniFB01 l (see Table 2). Although its logBB ratio is very modest, -0.89 32 (close to the lowest accepted ratio for a CNS drug, -1 147 ), tadala /uniFB01 l administration produces a su /uniFB03 ciently high CNS concentration to signi /uniFB01 cantly inhibit PDE5. A comprehensive analysis from a multivariate drug discovery perspective also leads tadala /uniFB01 l to become a more than acceptable candidate for reverting cognitive impairments.\\n\\nDue to its elevated expression in the brain 35 and the established role of cGMP in the regulation of synaptic function, PDE9 is a potential target to treat memory de /uniFB01 cits associated with aging and neurodegenerative disorders such as AD. 9,17,36 P /uniFB01 zer has developed PF-4447943 ( 10 ), a potent, selective, and brain-penetrant PDE9A inhibitor (logBB = -0.4, IC50 = 12 nM) that increases brain levels of cGMP in vivo 88 and that is 78 times more selective for PDE9A than for other PDE family\\n\\nTable 2.

PDE9A activity regulates neuronal cGMP signaling downstream of multiple neurotransmitter systems, and thus, its inhibition may have bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ects in the treatment of psychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. 153 However, the lack of results from a 2010 phase 2 clinical trial of subjects with mild to moderate AD 154 casts doubts on the utility of PDE9A inhibitors for the treatment of AD.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nInhibitors of PDE10A may regulate cyclic nucleotide signaling in the corticostriatothalamic circuit. However the extra-striatal expression of PDE10A 37,40 suggests that these inhibitors may also be used to treat cognitive de /uniFB01 cits associated with schizophrenia. 155,156 The PDE10A inhibitor TP-10 ( 11 ) is active in a variety of preclinical models that suggest it may be e /uniFB03 cacious in the treatment of schizophrenia. 44 Similar e /uniFB00 ects have been reported for papaverine ( 12 ), another PDE10A inhibitor that also improves novel object recognition in rats. 157 Although both compounds increase cGMP and cAMP levels, and CREB phosphorylation, a bene /uniFB01 cial e /uniFB00 ect on cognition has only been described for papaverine, which appears to be a positive ' side-e /uniFB00 ect ' . 44,157 These di /uniFB00 erential e /uniFB00 ects are poorly understood and may re /uniFB02 ect the speci /uniFB01 c localization of PDE10A in CNS cells. De /uniFB01 ning the speci /uniFB01 c localization of PDE variants in the brain will be fundamental to identify and select PDEs involved in cognition. A novel pharmacological tool compound, PF-02545920 ( 13 ), with optimal activity (IC 50 = 0.37 nM) and selectivity (&gt;1000 times more selective for PDE10A) that crosses the BBB (logBB is -0.06), 158 is currently being studied for the treatment of schizophrenia in phase 2 clinical trials. 154 This drug may be used to selectively increase the levels of cyclic nucleotides in brain areas where PDE10A resides, thereby allowing a careful evaluation of its functional role and its therapeutic value with respect to other PDEs.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## 8. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: A MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY PERSPECTIVE\\n\\nThe development of AD is preceded by a subtle cognitive decline that a /uniFB00 ects the individual ' s ability to perform their daily activities. Reversal of this decline represents an important unmet medical need, in which PDE inhibition may play a fundamental role.\\n\\nA considerable number of research studies have focused on the role of PDE inhibition in restoring memory function. Given the pro /uniFB01 le of currently available PDE5 inhibitors, both in terms of pharmacokinetics and safety, and their demonstrated e /uniFB03 cacy in vivo in animal models, clinical trials should be performed to determine their potential in AD patients. The cost-bene /uniFB01 t risk underlying such an approach could be assumed by public resources; perhaps, a drug for mild cognitive impairment is already available in the market. It should be noted that PDE5 inhibitors ful /uniFB01 ll a number of the new criteria desired in an anti-\\n\\nAD drug: they do not act via anti-amyloid mechanisms, they exhibit good blood-brain barrier penetration, they have long half-lives, and they increase cGMP levels, which in turn decrease GSK3 β activity and p-tau levels.\\n\\nIn addition to testing PDE5 inhibitors in clinical trials, several issues must be addressed to facilitate the identi /uniFB01 cation and validation of the most promising PDE isoforms to combat cognitive dysfunction. In particular, the precise localization of distinct PDEs in the brain must be determined, and a greater understanding of the localization of PDEs in di /uniFB00 erent parts of the neuron is required. The development of radiolabeled analogues for PET imaging may also add additional value to current pharmacological tool compounds. Finally, the inhibitors of choice should act on the PDEs speci /uniFB01 cally located in regions directly involved in cognition, and potential side e /uniFB00 ects must be taken into account.\\n\\n## ■ AUTHOR INFORMATION\\n\\n## Corresponding Author\\n\\n* E-mail: agosta@unav.es.\\n\\n## Author Contributions\\n\\n§ These authors contributed equally to this work.\\n\\n## Author Contributions\\n\\nA.G.-O., M.C.-T., J.O., and R.F. researched the scienti /uniFB01 c literature, wrote sections of the manuscript and prepared diagrams and /uniFB01 gures and contributed equally to this work.

Neurother. 10(5), 711-728 (2010)\\n\\nAlzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease for which no cure exists. There is a substantial need for new therapies that offer improved symptomatic benefit and diseaseslowing capabilities. In recent decades there has been substantial progress in understanding the molecular and cellular changes associated with Alzheimer's disease pathology. This has resulted in identification of a large number of new drug targets. These targets include, but are not limited to, therapies that aim to prevent production of or remove the amyloidb protein that accumulates in neuritic plaques; to prevent the hyperphosphorylation and aggregation into paired helical filaments of the microtubule-associated protein tau; and to keep neurons alive and functioning normally in the face of these pathologic challenges. We provide a review of these targets for drug development.\\n\\nKEYWORDS: amyloidb · b -secretase · g -secretase · Alzheimer's disease · dementia · immunotherapy · tau · therapeutic · treatment\\n\\nRecent research findings have led to greater understanding of disease neurobiology in Alzheimer's disease (AD) and identification of unique targets for drug development. Current therapeutic options aim at transmitter targets secondary to AD pathology. They offer limited efficacy and do not slow disease progression. The next generation of drugs for AD will alter the underlying disease course and/or provide greater symptomatic benefit. Targets for these drugs were identified in the study of AD pathophysiology and include, but are not limited to, the molecular events that result in the production and accumulation of the amyloidb (A b ) protein in neuritic plaques and the  hyperphosphorylation,  condensation  and aggregation of the microtubule-associated protein tau in neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). We review many of these targets, including those for which clinical development is ongoing or imminent. We begin by discussing current and emerging symptomatic targets (BOX 1) , then we review targets with disease-modifying potential (BOX 2) .\\n\\n## Targets Symptomatic targets\\n\\nCurrently available therapies\\n\\nFive  medications  are  currently  approved  by the US FDA for the treatment of AD. These agents, while providing important and useful symptomatic benefit, have limited or no impact on the underlying biology of AD, and limited or no impact on disease progression. Targets for these therapies are neurotransmitter-based. The acetylcholinesterase  inhibitors  (AChEIs)  prevent the degradation of progressively decreasing acetylcholine (ACh) levels. AChEIs are effective throughout the course of AD [1-8] .  The other class  of  approved  medications  includes  only memantine, which regulates excitatory glutamatergic function and improves cognition in moderate-to-severe AD [9,10] . Administered together, these classes of medication may have enhanced symptomatic and long-term effects [11,12] . Altered neurotransmission in AD provides an array of targets for new drugs to improve cognition in the face of pathological challenge.\\n\\n## Nicotinic receptor agonism\\n\\nThe  cholinergic  system  is  well  studied  in AD.  Neuronal  nicotinic  receptors  (NNRs) for ACh are decreased in the AD brain [13,14] and  this  reduction  correlates  with  cognitive impairment [15] . Most NNR agonists cross the BBB [16,17] . NNR agonists have been shown to improve cognition in small uncontrolled studies of normal volunteers [18] and AD patients [19] . Animal  model  studies  suggest  that  these agents are as effective at improving cognitive\\n\\n## Box 1.

Larger,  better-controlled clinical trials of NNR agonists will inform of their safety and efficacy in AD. No agents have been approved with NNRs as their target. A recent completed trial of one agent, AB-108, failed to meet its cognitive end points.\\n\\n## GABA receptor agonism &amp; antagonism\\n\\nAs neurons that supply excitatory neurotransmission are lost in AD, inhibitory systems, such as GABA neurotransmission, may go unchecked and result in cognitive impairment [21] . There is disagreement in the literature as to whether GABAergic neurons are less susceptible to the pathology of AD [22-24] , relative to excitatory neurons, or if levels of the neurotransmitter [25] and both GABA A and GABA B receptors [26] are decreased in AD. Regardless, agents that stabilize this system may modulate excitatory tone and reduce excitotoxicity. One selective GABA B receptor antagonist was clinically investigated in mild cognitive impairment [27] , but subsequently failed to demonstrate efficacy in AD [28] . Alternatively, inverse agonists of the GABA A receptor benzodiazepine-binding site (believed to reduce synaptic inhibition by reducing chloride ion flux) may enhance cognition [29] . Off-target effects, such as seizures and anxiety, are a concern in compounds with inverse agonist or antagonist properties at the GABA receptor. A Phase II clinical trial of etazolate, a GABA A receptor modulator, recently completed enrollment. The synthetic GABA analog 3-amino-1propanesulfonic acid (also known as tramiprosate or Alzhemed ® ), was actively pursued as a treatment for AD, based more on its affinity for A b than any GABAergic properties [30] .\\n\\n## Serotonergic modulation\\n\\nOf the 14 different serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) receptor subtypes, several, including 5-HT 1A , 5-HT 4 and 5-HT 6 , are expressed in areas important to learning and memory [31] and significantly decline in AD [32-36] . Levels of serotonin receptors (5-HTRs) may also change in very mild disease [33,37,38] , further implicating these receptors in the cognitive impairment associated with AD. 5-HTRs may also be altered in other dementias [39] . The role of the 5-HTRs is complex, including regulation of a variety of other neurotransmitter systems, such as ACh, dopamine, GABA and glutamate [31] .  In line with this complexity, both selective agonists [40,41] and antagonists [42-45] of 5-HTRs have beneficial cognitive effects in animal models. One selective 5-HT 1A receptor antagonist has reached Phase I investigation in man as a treatment for AD [46] . Results from a Phase II trial of a 5-HT 6 antagonist are encouraging [47] .\\n\\n## Histamine H3 receptor antagonism\\n\\nFour subtypes of histamine receptor exist and among them the H3 receptor is highly expressed in the human brain, including in areas important to memory function [48] . H3 functions as a presynaptic autoreceptor and a postsynaptic heteroreceptor and regulates histamine function, as well as release of a variety of neurotransmitters. Antagonists and inverse agonists of the H3 receptor increase neurotransmitter levels of ACh, dopamine, norepinephrine and 5-HT [49] .  Expression of H3 receptors in the periphery is limited, relative to expression in the brain. Unlike many other receptor systems, H3 receptor levels are maintained through the course of AD progression [50] . Development of H3 antagonists is, therefore, a promising target for AD therapies as well as a variety of other CNS disorders [51] . Clinical trials of H3 antagonists in AD are now underway [49,301] .\\n\\n## Phosphodiesterase inhibition\\n\\nImproving synaptic function may provide a target for symptomatic therapy in AD. The cyclic-AMP response element-binding protein (CREB) is a transcription factor that is important to memory [52,53] and downregulated in models of altered synaptic function related to AD [54] . In transgenic animal models of AD, synaptic long-term potentiation can be restored through enhancement of the CREB pathway by increasing cGMP through inhibition of phosphodiesterase (PDE). This appears to be true for pan-PDE inhibitors, such as caffeine [55] , and for more specific PDE inhibitors [56,57] . New inhibitors of specific PDE subtypes have been identified [58] ,  but previously approved agents, such as those indicated for treatment of erectile dysfunction, are also being investigated [57,59] . The wide use of the latter suggests the likely safety of this class of agents in elderly subjects.\\n\\n## Metabolic enhancement\\n\\nBrain hypometabolism is an early consequence of AD pathology [60,61] .  The early occurrence of cerebral hypometabolism in AD makes it unlikely to result from neuronal loss but instead is probably a result of synaptic dysfunction. Therefore, increasing glucose metabolism in the AD brain may provide symptomatic improvement. Glucose administration improves memory performance in healthy elderly participants [62] . In AD patients, however, glucose administration failed to improve cognitive performance [63] . Provision of alternative energy supplies, such as ketogenic substances, may improve brain metabolism and cognition [64] . One ketogenic dietary agent has recently been shown in a double-blind placebo-controlled trial to improve symptoms in AD [65] , and has subsequently received marketing permission from the FDA as a medical food.\\n\\nTreatment with insulin also improves memory performance in AD [63] . The dysregulation of insulin in diabetes appears to increase risk for AD [66] and the insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE;\\n\\nalso known as insulysin) also degrades A b [67,68] . These facts led to the investigation of the PPARg agonist rosiglitazone as a treatment for AD [69] . Larger trials of rosiglitazone were made more difficult by cardiovascular health risks for this class of agents and one trial recently failed to demonstrate efficacy [70] . Direct intranasal administration of insulin can also improve cognitive function in AD [71] . Larger studies will be needed to confirm the symptomatic efficacy of intranasal insulin administration.\\n\\n## Disease-modifying targets\\n\\n## Amyloidb\\n\\nWith extensive basic and clinical science support, the amyloid hypothesis remains the most prominent theory of AD pathology and target for drug development [72-76] .  Central  to  this hypo  thesis is the proteolytic processing of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) [77] .  Post-translational modification of APP occurs through two paths, beginning with cleavage by either a - or b -site enzymes. In either case, the produced C-terminal fragment is membrane-tethered and further processed within the transmembrane region by g -secretase. g -secretase cleavage of the a -secretase product yields an apparently nontoxic protein fragment (p3), whereas the product of sequential b -site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE) and g -secretase cleavages is the 38-43-amino acid fibrillogenic A b [77] . The 42-amino acid A b 42 is most prone to aggregation, found in the core of neuritic plaques, and - when aggregated into oligomers - is largely considered the key pathological component in AD. Deposits of A b can occur anywhere that APP, BACE and g -secretase are found, and this includes both intra- and extra-cellular spaces [78] . Aggregates of A b are toxic to synapses and neurons. Initial stages of aggregation, ranging from dimeric to dodecomeric soluble aggregates, are believed to be most toxic and are collectively referred to as A b oligomers [79] .\\n\\nThe amyloid hypothesis is supported by the largely identical clinical and pathologic phenotype among the sporadic late onset AD and the rare inherited early onset form of AD that results from autosomal-dominant mutations to the genes for APP and two of the subunits in g -secretase (presenilin-1 and -2) [73,80-82] . Over 150 mutations that result in this familial AD have now been identified, all of which exclusively involve these three genes integrally involved in A b production [81] . The largest number of disease-modifying drug candidates for AD target APP processing and A b by: limiting production of the toxic form of A b ; removing A b from the brain through degradation, transport or immunotherapeutic mobilization; or preventing the toxic effects of A b .\\n\\n## A b\\n\\na\\n\\nproduction -secretase activation\\n\\nIncreasing production of nonamyloidogenic products of APP processing through activation of a -secretase could provide a drug target for reducing pathologic A b . Few compounds that successfully activate a -secretase have been identified. Among those that have, receptor agonists for subtypes of muscarinic ACh receptors (mAChR) are appealing. Among the five different mAChR subtypes, M 1 is highly expressed in hippocampus and cortex and involved in cognition [83] . Loss of M 1 function induces cognitive\\n\\n## Box 2.

M 1 (and M 3 ) receptor agonism also regulates APP processing by increasing a -secretase activity and inhibiting g -secretase [85,86] . It is not yet known whether mAChR function in AD is impaired and will limit the efficacy of selective agents that target M 1 [87] . Treatment of AD patients with an M 1 agonist, however, reduces cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) A b [88] and M 1 agonists are in development for AD [87] .\\n\\n## b -secretase inhibition\\n\\nCleavage of APP by BACE (also known as b -secretase and memapsin-2) is the first step in the proteolytic processing of APP, making it the ideal position in the cascade to intervene and halt production of all post-translational products. BACE activity is increased in sporadic forms of AD [89-91] . BACE knockouts have limited phenotypic changes beyond reduced levels of A b [92,93] , suggesting that potent inhibitors may have limited side-effect profiles. Development of agents capable of inhibiting the multisite activity of BACE on its APP substrate has been difficult. Successful inhibition initially required large molecules (&gt;500 kDa) that were unable to cross the BBB [94] . Highly lipophilic, smaller orally available agents that have access to the CNS have recently been developed, however, and such agents are currently in human clinical trials [95] .\\n\\ng -secretase inhibition\\n\\nThe rationale for targeting g -secretase is similar to that of BACE; prevention of g -secretase action inhibits post-translational processing of APP and formation of A b . g -secretase is a four-part complex, consisting of the membrane proteins presenilin-1 or -2, nicastrin, Aph-1 and Pen-2 (reviewed in [96] ). Of these, presenilin serves as the catalytic subunit. Presenilin-mediated catabolism is critical not only to APP proteolysis but also to a variety of other trans  membrane proteins including the Notch signaling receptor. Cleavage of the Notch transmembrane receptor by presenilin permits nuclear translocation of the Notch signaling protein. Presenilin knockouts are lethal and phenotypically similar to Notch knockouts, suggesting the critical role of presenilin cleavage in Notch signaling [97] . The role of Notch in development is well described and includes regulating proliferation, cell fate decisions and cellular growth [98-100] . In adult physiology Notch signaling continues to play a major role, and potent inhibition of Notch cleavage and signaling by presenilin/ g -secretase inhibitors may result in intolerable or dangerous adverse events related to gastrointestinal, lymphatic, skin and immune system toxicity [101] . Therefore, targeting g -secretase is a binary challenge. Activity must sufficiently lower A b to have clinical impact (the degree of A b -lowering to accomplish this is not yet known). Moreover, this activity must be selective to brain g -secretase and not result in intolerability or dangerous side effects due to Notch toxicity. To this point, the primary strategy to balance efficacy and tolerability has been to pursue agents with minimal Notch activity. Multiple agents have now entered clinical trials [102-104] . g -secretase inhibitors are capable of reducing plasma A b [105] and lowering CSF production of A b in AD patients and normal volunteers, respectively [106,107] . LY450139 is a g -secretase inhibitor currently in Phase III clinical trials [301] .\\n\\nAlternatively, agents that modulate g -secretase (without directly preventing cleavage) may selectively lower A b without altering Notch activity. Early studies identified a variety of NSAIDs and NSAID-like compounds that could reduce A b production in vitro , that did not act on Notch or on the cyclooxygenases [108,109] . Among these, R-flurbiprofen advanced through clinical development but failed to demonstrate efficacy in a large Phase III clinical trial [110,111] . Brain penetration of the agent may have been inadequate. Although these results were disappointing, g -secretase modulators may still hold promise as a therapeutic class. Target sites other than presenilin may be plausible and drugs that act through conformational inhibition, rather than direct catalytic inhibition, would not induce Notch-related toxicity [112] . Additionally, Kukar and colleagues recently demonstrated that some NSAIDs can modulate g -secretase activity through APP binding, suggesting another potential path to reduce A b without Notch toxicity [113] . Drugs that block g -secretase activity through substrate binding may have the added benefit of acting as A b aggregation inhibitors.\\n\\nDegradation of A b\\n\\nOnce present in the brain, the toxic form of A b must either be degraded or removed to prevent the clinical development of dementia [114] . Multiple endogenous pathways for A b degradation exist and include neutral endopeptidase (also known as neprilysin) [115,116] ,\\n\\nIDE, endothelin-converting enzyme [117,118] , angiotensin-converting enzyme and metalloproteinase 9. Of these, neprilysin and IDE are thought to be the primary regulators of A b degradation, as well as the optimal drug targets [119] . Levels of A b degrading enzymes are reduced in AD [120] . Furthermore, transgenic animals that lack the proteases key to A b degradation show increased brain A b deposition in a gene dose-dependent fashion [121] , whereas APP transgenic mice that overexpress the neprilysin transgene demonstrate increased A b degradation (seen as a reduction in total soluble A b and plaque burden) [122] . These animals, however, showed no reduction of oligomeric A b and no improvement in memory performance relative to APP mice [122] . APP transgenic mice engineered to overexpress IDE and neprilysin have reduced A b levels, virtually no plaque formation and reduced astrogliosis, microgliosis and dystrophic neurites [123] . These transgenic animals also show improved spatial memory in at least some models [124] .\\n\\nIncreased levels of neprilysin through viral vector-delivered gene expression can lower A b in mouse models of AD [125,126] . Alternatively, molecular regulators of neprilysin levels in vivo could provide a more easily accomplished pharmacologic target [127] . Cabrol and colleagues recently completed a high-throughput screen in which they identified multiple small molecule activators of IDE [128] , suggesting that pharmacological manipulation of A b degradation enzymes is a realistic target for disease modification in AD. Given the number of degrading enzymes, it is important to demonstrate that inhibiting one pathway is adequate for a therapeutic benefit. Alternatively, multiple degradative pathways could be targeted.\\n\\nRemoval of A b Vaccination\\n\\nVaccination with the full length A b peptide decreases amyloid burden and abrogates learning and memory impairment in animal models of AD [129,130] . Recent animal model investigations suggest that vaccination can reduce amlyoid burden as well as NFT pathology [131] . A clinical trial of A b vaccination (AN1792) in 300 mild AD patients was halted owing to a 6% incidence of T-cellmediated meningoencephalitis [132] . Preliminary results suggested a clinical benefit in participants who received therapy and generated antibodies against A b [133] . Analysis of the primary outcomes at the time of trial interruption demonstrated no drug-placebo difference [134] .  Long-term follow up of survivors suggested a benefit in activities of daily living, quantified with the Disability Assessment for Dementia scale, among antibody responders [135] . However, long-term follow-up to autopsy of the first subjects to die demonstrated that there was no impact on clinical progression to advanced dementia, despite removal of plaque burden in the cortex among antibody responders [136,137] . Furthermore, initial pathological analysis suggested that while A b removal was successful, NFT pathology was unaltered [138] . These findings have sparked continued debate as to whether A b provides the appropriate target for AD therapies [139] . Nevertheless, clinical development of immunotherapies for AD, including active vaccinations, remains a major research focus. Full length A b vaccinations, as well as peptide fragment vaccinations, are in development [28] .\\n\\n## Passive immunization\\n\\nPassive immunization attempts to provide A b -lowering and the potential clinical benefit of vaccination, while avoiding the T-cellmediated response. Transgenic mouse studies confirm that the beneficial effects of vaccination, including removal of A b burden, reductions in aggregated tau and amelioration of cognitive deficit, can be achieved with passive antibody therapy [140-142] . The exact mechanism of action for antibody therapy remains elusive, although several not mutually exclusive hypotheses have support from basic science. Activation of microglia enhances breakdown of A b . The occurrence of 'moth-eaten' plaques and increased immunohistochemical evidence of microglial response in vaccinated antibody responders that have come to autopsy from the AN1792 study support the hypothesis that immunotherapy enhances microglial response against A b [136] . Similarly, microglial activation occurs in response to vaccination [143] and passive immunization [144] in transgenic models of AD and is critical for reducing A b burden [145] . Additionally, antibodies may trap A b in the brain blood vasculature and transport it to the periphery where it can be more effectively degraded. Deglycosylated antibodies, which fail to activate the microglial response, persist in their ability to remove A b from the brains of mouse models of AD [146,147] . Similarly, passive immunization of transgenic animals that lack the Fc receptor necessary for microglial activation exhibit A b removal [148] . A variety of antibody therapies are now in clinical development, with two monoclonal antibody therapies in Phase III trials - bapineuzumab and solanezumab.\\n\\nInterestingly, plaques in the brains of untreated AD patients are decorated with IgG antibodies, and these antibodies appear to elicit a microglial response [149] . Although this is insufficient for staving off clinical impairment, an inverse relationship exists between IgG level and plaque burden [149] .  Therapeutic use of naturally produced autoantibodies in the form of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) as treatment for AD is a current area of clinical investigation. IVIg treatment increased plasma and decreased CSF levels of A b in a study of eight AD patients [150] . IVIg is in a large multisite clinical trial in the USA.\\n\\n## A b transport\\n\\nBeside age, the most well established risk factor for AD is the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genetic status. Three isotypes of ApoE exist: e 2, e 3 and e 4. e 2 and e 4 are distinguished from e 3 by only single amino acid substitutions [151] . Individuals carrying one or two copies of the e 4 allele are at increased risk to develop AD and to do so at an earlier age [152] .  In those with AD [153] and those at risk for AD [154] , e 4 carrier status results in increased A b deposition in the brain. Apolipoproteins play a role in A b metabolism and transport [155] ; they do not cross the BBB [151] , but may regulate passage of A b between the CNS and the periphery. The extent to which the different isoforms of ApoE bind A b is debated (reviewed in [155] ). ApoE e 4 may increase passage of A b from blood to brain [156] . Mouse models that overproduce and deposit A b ,  when combined with transgenic animals that lack ApoE, have reduced A b deposition [157] . Synthesized compounds that prevent ApoE binding to A b reduce plaque deposition and memory impairment in animal models of AD [158] .  This may provide an avenue for therapeutic intervention in AD; although benefit may depend on e 4 carrier status.\\n\\nIt  is  likely  that  ApoE  carries  A b to  a  receptor  that  facilitates passage across the BBB [114] .  The low-density lipoprotein receptor-related  protein  (LRP)  seems  to  be  involved  in  such receptor-  mediated passage of A b [159] .  Antibodies against the LRP reduce  A b efflux  from  the  brain [160] .  With  age,  LRP expression is decreased and LRP-mediated A b efflux is reduced, increasing the risk for A b build-up and clinical onset of AD [160] . Mechanistically, LRP has been shown to bind, endocytose and trancytose A b , although questions remain over LRP affinity for A b 40 versus A b 42 [161] . Nevertheless, peripheral administration of soluble LRP in AD as a mechanism to pull A b out of the brain has been proposed as a potential therapy [162] .\\n\\nAs an alternative to enhancing A b removal from the brain, it may be useful to prevent its entry to the CNS from peripheral sources. The receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE) is a multiligand receptor expressed by a variety of cell types throughout the body [163] and brain [164,165] . RAGE binds A b with high affinity and expression of the receptor is increased in AD [164,166] .  Preventing ligands from binding RAGE lowers brain levels of A b [167] . Therefore, a variety of compounds that aim to inhibit RAGE interaction with its endogenous ligands or provide soluble alternative receptor binding are in development as treatments for AD. One such compound is currently being investigated in a Phase II clinical trial.\\n\\nThus, brain levels of A b are determined by a complex equation including production, removal and degradation. While production of A b is  largely understood, removal and degradation are multifactorial and the role of each possible pathway remains to be fully comprehended. The balance (or imbalance) between the mechanisms by which brain A b levels are maintained, and the causal link between this balance and AD, remains uncertain and debated [168] .\\n\\n## A b oligomerization\\n\\nThe most synaptotoxic form of A b is neither the constitutive monomeric form nor the fibrillar form deposited in plaques [79,169-171] . The greatest A b -derived toxicity results from initial aggregation stages, when monomeric A b first oligomerizes into dimers, trimers and other high-molecular-weight combinations. Oligomer reduction is the most compelling target in the A b cascade; reducing fibrillar A b may have little or no cognitive benefit. Animals with reduced plaque burden but high oligomer levels have no improvement in cognitive function [170,172] . It is plausible that A b plaques act as an endogenous sink, removing toxic oligomeric A b from the parenchyma [170] , or they may serve as reservoirs for oligomeric A b . Estimates of how much total A b is soluble at any one time are as low as 5%. In one animal model, reduction of soluble A b levels by 25% reduced plaque formation but had no effect on plaque burden [173] .\\n\\nThe  aggregation  properties  of  A b are  fairly  well  established [174-176] and provide anti-aggregation targets for drug development (FIGURE 1) [177] .  Glabe and colleagues recently identified\\n\\nunique inhibitors capable of preventing oligomerization, fibrillization or both [178] .  Furthermore, single agents may be able to decrease oligomerization while promoting fibrillization [179] . These findings support the hypothesis that multiple pathways of A b aggregation exist and may need to be further explored to optimize drug development that aims to reduce oligomers.\\n\\nThe only agent aiming to prevent A b aggregation thus far tested in a large Phase III trial - tramiprosate - failed to meet its primary end point. It remains unclear whether this agent lacked efficacy because it prevented fibrillization but not oligomerization of A b , or if A b is an inappropriate target [28] . Additionally, trial irregularities - including abnormal variance among study sites and lower than expected placebo decline - make it difficult to draw conclusions about drug efficacy.\\n\\nA variety of other agents that specifically aim to prevent the oligomerization of A b are also in development. Cyclohexanehexol (also known as AZD-103) prevents oligomerization in vitro [180] , abrogates A b oligomer-induced impairments to long-term potentiation [181] and alleviates AD cognitive impairment in a mouse model [181,182] . AZD-103 was safely tolerated in a human Phase I trial.\\n\\ncan reduce AD pathological burden in the brain [194-196] .  For these reasons, each of these classes of compounds have been or will be tested in human clinical trials as therapies for AD [80,301] .\\n\\nBush and colleagues have proposed a metal-related hypothesis of A b aggregation [197] . In this model, metal ions, such as copper and zinc, released with synaptic activity, promote the oligomerization of monomeric A b [198,199] . Such metal ions are elevated in AD [200] and are localized to plaques [201] . Based on these findings, a metal protein-attenuating compound was tested in a clinical trial [197] .  PBT2 demonstrated initial efficacy in AD, lowering CSF levels of A b and mitigating cognitive deterioration relative to placebo [202-204] . However, the specific mechanism of action of PBT2 remains debated [205] and roles for the drug beyond local metal chelation have been proposed. At least one report suggests that clioquinol (another metal protein-attenuating compound) may act in the mitochondria to inhibit enzymatic activity believed to underlie cellular aging [206] .\\n\\nTau &amp; NFTs\\n\\nOther compounds may similarly inhibit oligomerization of A b , including grape-derived polyphenols [183,184] , omega-3 fatty acids, such as docosahexaenoic acid [185] ,  and curcumin [185] . In addition to potentially being aggregation inhibitors, each of these compounds are potent antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents [186,187] . Epidemiologic studies of dietary intake [188-191] and comparisons of geographic regions where consumption is high for these compounds [192,193] suggest that consistent consumption can reduce risk for AD. Supplementing the diets of transgenic animals with these compounds confirms that they\\n\\nThe second pathological hallmark of AD is the intracellular NFT. NFTs are condensed cytoskeletal inclusions composed of hyperphosphorylated paired helical filaments of the microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPtau or tau). In contrast to the axon-specific expression of tau in developing and healthy neurons [207] , in AD hyperphosphorylated tau is translocated to the somatodendritic compartment. Phosphorylation of tau is critical to its function, but hyperphosphorylated tau no longer binds to microtubules, instead aggregating into paired helical filaments [208] . The result is a general instability of microtubules and disruption of axonal transport that leads to neuronal injury and cell death. Increased levels of\\n\\nFigure 1.

Although it is argued that a stronger link exists between NFT topography and clinical phenotype [210] , development of therapies targeting NFTs has lagged behind those that target A b [211] . Therapies targeting tau aim to reduce, stabilize or prevent hyperphosphorylation or aggregation of the protein.\\n\\nTotal tau\\n\\nMultiple basic science models suggest that reducing tau can alleviate A b -dependent or A b -independent cognitive impairment in  neurodegenerative  models [212,213] . However, given that tau is a constitutive part of the cell, removing tau entirely is not likely to be a realistic target.\\n\\nTau aggregation\\n\\nOligomers of tau are part of normal functioning  for  the  microtubule-associated protein and departure from this oligomeric structure into more aggregated compounds\\n\\nmay represent the pathological step in tau processing [214] . Classes of agents that may act to prevent tau aggregation include anthraquinones,  polyphenols,  aminothienopyridazines  and  phenothiazines [215] . Wischik and colleagues have begun clinical development of the phenothiazine methylene blue as a treatment for AD [216,217] . The initial clinical trial of this agent failed to meet its prespecified end points but long-term observations and biomarker studies suggested possible benefit. Clinical development in AD continues. Methylene blue also decreases A b oligomers in vitro by increasing fibrillar but not monomeric A b [179] .\\n\\n## Tau hyperphosphorylation\\n\\nMost of the drug development aiming at tau has targeted reducing hyperphosphorylation. Phosphorylation of tau can occur at many unique sites of the protein and through multiple pathways [218-220] . Among the various kinases involved in hyperphosphorylation of tau, glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 b and the cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (cdk5) both target multiple phosphorylation sites on tau [221] , suggesting therapeutic potential for preventing the formation of NFTs [219] . Interactions between GSK-3 b and cdk5 exist, and will require further evaluation to optimize treatments aimed at these kinases [222,223] .\\n\\nLithium and valproate are commonly used agents that have inhibitory actions on GSK-3 b and may stabilize tau [211] . Small and open-label studies have suggested efficacy of these agents as therapies for cognitive and behavioral symptoms in AD [224-226] . Larger, more controlled studies have failed to confirm efficacy for both lithium [227] and valproate [228] .\\n\\nAgents with more appealing tolerability and safety profiles, but still able to inhibit GSK-3 b and stabilize tau, are likely to reach clinical investigation in the near future. Recent findings suggest that caffeine inhibits GSK-3 b [229] , in addition to inhibiting PDE (see previous). Given epidemiologic findings of decreased incidence of AD in heavy caffeine users [230] and efficacy of caffeine in A b transgenic animal models [231,232] , further exploration of caffeine as a therapy for AD is warranted.\\n\\nPhosphatases dephosphorylate tau and may offer an alternative to inhibition of hyperphosphorylation. Protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) has been described to play a large role in regulation of tau phosphorylation and is decreased in AD [233-235] . Inhibition of PP2A is sufficient to result in hyperphosphorylation of tau, formation of NFT-like structures and memory impairment in animal models [236,237] . Multiple PP2As exist and agents that can increase activity of these phosphatases, perhaps by targeting the endogenous proteins that inhibit their activity, are logical drug candidates for AD treatment [238,239] .\\n\\nNAP is an eight-amino acid peptide (with N-A-P representing the first three amino acids in the peptide) believed to represent the active component of the glial-derived activitydependent neuroprotective protein [240] . Unlike other trophic factors, which work via receptor-based mechanisms of action, NAP enters the  neuron  and  interacts  directly  with  microtubules [241] . NAP has a potent ability in vitro to rescue neurons from A b -induced cell death [242] and can also reduce tau phosphorylation [243] . NAP treatment has demonstrated efficacy in the triple transgenic mouse model of AD [244,245] . Intranasally administered NAP treatment can cross the BBB [246] and has reached clinical investigation [240] .\\n\\nIt remains unclear whether therapies that alleviate A b pathology only or tau pathology only will ameliorate (or prevent) the cognitive decline in AD [212,247] . It is also important to note that therapies that successfully target tau may have applications beyond AD. Tau hyperphosphorylation is common in other forms of dementia, creating the possibility that successful tau-stabilizing agents will offer therapeutic efficacy in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including the frontotemporal dementias, progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration [248,249] .\\n\\n## Neuroprotection\\n\\nNeuroprotective strategies aim to ensure cell health in the presence of disease-specific pathology. These include therapies that reduce inflammation or other downstream markers of AD pathobiology.  For  example,  epidemiologic findings have suggested disease-preventing properties for the NSAIDs [250,251] and the statins [252,253] .  The mechanisms by which these agents reduce AD, if they do, are not entirely clear. The anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDs and the cholesterol-lowering properties of statins might both be useful in preventing or treating AD. Both classes of agents, however, may also reduce A b [254] . Prospective randomized placebo-controlled studies of NSAIDs have, thus far, failed to demonstrate efficacy as treatments [255-257] , although some studies were halted for safety concerns and thus prevented full examination [258] . There is a more mixed literature relating to statins. The Religious Orders Study [259] and Cardiovascular Health Study [260] found no effect of statin use on AD occurrence or neuropathology, but Li and colleagues demonstrated a reduced risk for NFT burden in statin users when examining participants followed longitudinally [261] .  A prospective trial of 67 mild-to-moderate AD patients randomized to atorvostatin or placebo suggested a clinical benefit with treatment [262] . As a result of these findings, a larger prospective trial of atorvastatin and donepezil was initiated but failed to show a drug-placebo difference [263,264] .\\n\\nMitochondrial dysfunction plays a clear role in cell death [265,266] . Cellular aging and neurodegenerative disease mutate mitochondrial DNA, alter mitochondrial membrane permeability and generally impair mitochondrial function [267,268] . In AD, soluble A b enters the mitochondria [269] and results in mitochondrial membrane dysfunction, Ca 2+  entry, reduced energy production and oxidative stress that may ultimately lead  to  neuronal  cell  death [268,270] .  Agents  that  stabilize the mitochondrial membrane, prevent mitochondrial DNA mutation, remove reactive oxygen species or improve mitochondrial function may prevent age-related cellular changes and  counteract  neurodegenerative  disease,  including  AD. Dimebon (dimebolin, latrepirdine) is a nonselective antihistamine previously approved in Russia, now being developed for AD and Huntington's disease, that may target mitochondrial membranes [271] .  In  addition to low affinity effects on AChE and glutamate receptors, dimebon appears to stabilize\\n\\nmitochondrial permeability transition pores, preventing ionic influx [267] .  Doody and colleagues recently published results from a clinical trial of this agent in 183 mild-to-moderate AD patients [271] .  After 26 weeks, patients receiving therapy showed improvement relative to placebo on the Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive  subscale  (ADAS-cog),  Alzheimer's  Disease Cooperative Study - Activities of Daily Living scale (ADCSADL),  Clinician  Interview-Based  Impression  of  Change (CIBIC)-plus and Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) outcomes. Blinded extension study to 12 months [271] and  open-label extension to 18 months [272] demonstrated continued benefit of therapy. Phase III testing of this agent is ongoing.\\n\\nHistones are proteins that organize chromatin within the cell nucleus. Histone regulation occurs by a variety of epigenetic modifiers, including methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination  and  ribosylation [273] .  Among  these,  the  balance between histone acetyltransferase and histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity may be particularly relevant to synaptic function and memory, and may become unbalanced in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases [274] .  Moreover, re-establishing this balance or increasing histone tail acetylation through inhibition of HDACs may facilitate memory recovery through synapse formation and dendritic growth [275] . Multiple classes of HDACs exist, composed of at least ten subtypes. Recent work suggests that the HDAC2, but not HDAC1, subfamily of deacetylases is critical to synaptic function and may be an appropriate target for development of new therapies [276] . One small trial of nicotinamide, a class III HDAC inhibitor, improved memory in a triple transgenic mouse model of AD [277] . A trial of this agent has been initiated in AD patients [301] .\\n\\nNeurotrophic factors have long been known to promote survival and growth of neurons during CNS development, leading to great interest in the therapeutic application of these factors in the diseased adult brain [278] .  Despite in vitro and animal model successes, trophic factor therapies have thus far failed in clinical investigation, either as a result of lack of efficacy or intolerability, in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders [278-280] . Issues with growth factor tolerability probably result from potent but often nonspecific neuritogenic activity [281,282] .  Recent  development  of  more  targeted  delivery approaches will allow for further evaluation of neurotrophic factor efficacy. In AD, NGF delivery to the trk-A receptor-expressing cholinergic neurons of the nucleus basalis of Meynert, which are known to be susceptible early in disease [283] , may increase cell survival and enhance cholinergic supply to the neocortex and hippocampus [284-286] .  An  initial  trial  of  intracerebroventricular infusion of NGF offered limited efficacy and notable side effects [281] . Implantation of autologous fibroblasts genetically engineered to express NGF reduced the rate of cognitive decline and increased regional cerebral metabolism [284] . Focal delivery of gene therapy using adeno-associated virus-delivered neurotrophic factor DNA provides long-term expression of the transgene and protein production, with minimal trophic factor diffusion [287-289] . Clinical investigation of NGF gene therapy as a treatment for AD is ongoing. Similarly, cerebrolysin, a compound that mimics neurotrophic factor effects has been tested in a clinical trial and results suggest improved cognition in AD [290] .\\n\\n## Expert commentary\\n\\nAlzheimer's disease is a relentlessly progressive neurodegenerative disease that is increasing in prevalence rapidly. Elucidation of the pathophysiology of AD has resulted in better understanding of the preclinical events that lead to ostensible dementia. This pathophysiology includes the molecular and cellular events that lead to and result from the formation of amyloid plaques and NFTs. A multitude of drug targets related to AD biology have been identified, including those for which cognitive symptom improvement is the goal, and others for which disease slowing is the goal. Only through clinical testing of such agents will these targets be validated and true causal pathology of disease be confirmed.\\n\\n## Five-year view\\n\\nTo understand the immediate future in AD drug development, assessment of the current status of the field is necessary. We are on the cusp of a tremendous healthcare crisis as a result of AD. Already the source of immense societal cost, the number of AD cases in the USA and worldwide is expected to triple in the coming decades. We are also on the brink of drastic improvements in our armamentarium to treat and, perhaps, prevent AD. The field currently pursues new treatments as well as improvements in diagnosis. Simultaneous advances in these two arenas will allow us to at least delay the onset of this debilitating disorder through preclinical identification and initiation of disease-slowing treatments. Successful development of an agent capable of delaying AD onset by 5 years will reduce the total number of cases by half and an agent that can delay onset for 10 years will essentially eradicate AD [291] .\\n\\nGiven the urgent need for and strong focus on developing new classes of therapy for AD, there is opportunity for rapid translation of basic science findings into clinical investigation. Clinical trials  in  AD  have  met  great  challenges.  A  number  of  agents thought to hold promise have reached large-scale trials of efficacy only to fail to meet primary outcomes. Some of these have been\\n\\nTable 1.

However, it is less clear with other cases whether the drug failed or the trial did. Questions have arisen about optimal design for trials of disease-modifying therapies, placebo decline, statistical power and study conduct. Moreover, every failed trial in AD causes researchers to ask 'are we intervening early enough?' Many of these issues remain unresolved.\\n\\nThe next 5 years will almost certainly bring new findings that will enhance our target selection in AD. A large number of agents are now in the final phase of clinical development (TABLE 1) and in the next 5 years it is likely that we will be able to confirm efficacy for one or more agents capable of at least mildly slowing disease progression. When this occurs, clinical trials investigating how best to use these agents and when and in what order to initiate their use will be critical. Only after such therapies have completed clinical investigation, however, will we have new treatments to offer our patients. Thus, it is critical that all physicians who care for AD patients refer eligible patients for participation in clinical trials.\\n\\nFinally, debate remains over the definitive cause of the cognitive impairment in AD. It is conceivable that only through large-scale studies of agents for which cellular and molecular mechanisms of action can be confirmed will such debates finally be put to rest. That is, if a drug efficiently and completely removes A b from the AD brain and this entirely halts disease progression, ameliorates cognitive decline or reverses disease effects, it will suggest that amyloid, in and of itself, is the primary culprit in disease pathology leading to clinical phenomenology. While this example is an unlikely scenario, it is clear that we will also make great strides in better understanding the pathology of AD with the\\n\\n## References\\n\\nPapers of special note have been highlighted as:\\n\\n-  of interest\\n- ••  of considerable interest\\n- 1 Rogers SL, Doody RS, Mohs RC, Friedhoff LT.

Currently, there are no effective disease-  modifying treatments for AD. Mendelian randomisation (MR) has been widely used to repurpose licensed drugs and discover novel therapeutic targets. Thus, we aimed to identify novel therapeutic targets for AD and analyse their pathophysiological mechanisms and potential side effects.\\n\\nMethods A two-  sample MR integrating the identified druggable genes was performed to estimate the causal effects of blood and brain druggable expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) on AD. A repeat study was conducted using different blood and brain eQTL data sources to validate the identified genes. Using AD markers with available genome-  wide association studies data, we evaluated the causal relationship between established AD markers to explore possible mechanisms. Finally, the potential side effects of the druggable genes for AD treatment were assessed using a phenome-  wide MR.\\n\\nResults Overall, 5883 unique druggable genes were aggregated; 33 unique potential druggable genes for AD were identified in at least one dataset (brain or blood), and 5 were validated in a different dataset. Among them, three prior druggable genes (epoxide hydrolase 2 ( EPHX2 ), SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11 ) reached significant levels in both blood and brain tissues. EPHX2 may mediate the pathogenesis of AD by affecting the entire hippocampal volume. Further phenome-  wide MR analysis revealed no potential side effects of treatments targeting EPHX2 , SERPINB1 or SIGLEC11 .\\n\\nConclusions This study provides genetic evidence supporting the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting the three druggable genes for AD treatment, which will be useful for prioritising AD drug development.\\n\\n## BACKGROUND\\n\\nAlzheimer's  disease  (AD)  is  the  most  common neurodegenerative disease and is the leading cause  of  cognitive  impairment  and  dementia. 1 An estimated  6.5  million  Americans  aged  ≥65  years are  living  with  AD. 2 This  number  might  reach 13.8  million by 2060. 2 As an age-  dependent disease, AD is a threat to public health because of the rapid ageing of the world population. Over the past three decades, an increasing trend in the burden of AD has been observed globally. 3 The rapid increase in the  prevalence  and  societal  and  economic  burden\\n\\n## WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC\\n\\n- ⇒ The rapid increase in the prevalence and societal and economic burden of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has prompted an urgent need for efficient intervention and treatment for AD. Currently, there are no effective diseasemodifying treatments for AD.\\n\\n## WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS\\n\\n- ⇒ This study provides genetic evidence supporting the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting the three druggable genes (epoxide hydrolase 2 ( EPHX2 ), SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11 ) for AD treatment and analyses their pathophysiological mechanisms and potential side effects.\\n\\n## HOW THIS STUDY MIGHT AFFECT RESEARCH, PRACTICE OR POLICY\\n\\n- ⇒ Our study makes a significant contribution to the literature because we provide genetic evidence supporting the potential therapeutic benefits of targeting the three druggable genes for AD treatment, which will be useful for prioritising AD drug development.\\n\\nof  AD  has  prompted  an  urgent  need  for  efficient intervention and treatment for AD. 4\\n\\nHowever,  AD  treatment  remains  challenging. First, only a few drugs are available for AD. 5 Second, most approved drugs exert their therapeutic effects by targeting only a few specific molecular targets. For  example,  almost  all  antidementia  drugs  exert their  therapeutic  effects  by  inhibiting  cholines -terase  enzyme  or  glutaminergic  pathway. 6 Third, in  addition  to  their  beneficial  therapeutic  effects, antidementia drugs have considerable side effects, including nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, headache and constipation. 7 Importantly,  these  antide -mentia drugs cannot cure or delay AD progression; they only provide symptomatic treatment.\\n\\nOver  the  past  few  decades,  great  efforts  have been  made  to  explore  disease-  modifying  treat -ments  for  AD;  however,  little  progress  has  been achieved. Most agents targeting amyloid beta (A β ), aggregated tau, or neurofibrillary tangles may delay disease  progression,  but  there  is  no  substantial evidence  suggesting  their  clinical  benefits. 8 Therapeutic  stasis  is  primarily  attributed  to  unknown AD pathophysiology. Fortunately, large-  scale\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nhuman genetic studies  provide  an  opportunity  for  novel  drug development  for  many  complex  diseases  because  drug  targets supported by genetic evidence have a greater chance of success in drug discovery pipelines. 9 10 In other words, 'druggable' genes encoding proteins or gene expression can provide powerful clues to inform drug targets. 11 Over the past few years, numerous largescale genome-  wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many single-  nucleotide  polymorphisms  (SNPs)  associated  with AD risk. However, GWAS cannot clearly and directly provide clues regarding causal genes and drug targets because many iden -tified SNPs are located in non-  coding or intergene regions.\\n\\nMendelian randomisation (MR) is an approach used to assess the causality between a modifiable exposure or risk factor and a clinically relevant outcome. 12 MR analysis has been widely used to  repurpose  licensed  drugs 13 and  discover  novel  therapeutic targets 14  15 by  integrating  summary  data  from  disease  GWASs and  expression  quantitative  trait  locus  (eQTL)  studies.  The expression levels of a gene may be considered as a kind of life -long exposure, and eQTL located in the genomic region of the druggable genes are always considered as proxies. 16 17\\n\\nTherefore, we performed a systematic druggable genome-  wide MR to identify therapeutic targets for AD. First, a two-  sample\\n\\nMR analysis  was  performed  to  estimate  the  causal  effects  of blood and brain druggable eQTLs on AD. Second, we performed colocalisation  analyses  to  verify  the  robustness  of  the  expres -sion instrumental variables (IVs) and conducted a repeat study using different blood and brain eQTL data sources to validate the  identified  genes.  Third,  we  evaluated  the  causal  relationships between the identified genes and established AD markers to  explore  the  possible  mechanisms  by  which  these  genes  are involved in AD pathogenesis. Finally, we assessed the potential adverse effects of the identified druggable genes for AD treatment using a phenome-  wide MR.\\n\\n## MATERIALS AND METHODS\\n\\nThe overall study design is illustrated in figure 1. Further details of the methods and materials used are provided as follows.\\n\\n## Identification of druggable genes\\n\\nDruggable genes were obtained from the Drug-Gene Interaction Database (DGIdb V .4.2.0, https://www.dgidb.org/) 18 and a recent review  on  the  'druggability'  of  genes. 11 The  DGIdb  provides information  on  drug-gene  interactions  and  druggable  genes\\n\\nFigure 1 Overview of this study. First, we identified druggable genes. Second, a two-  sample MR was conducted to estimate the causal effects of blood and brain druggable eQTLs on AD. We then performed colocalisation analyses to verify the robustness of the expressions' IVs, and a repeat and validation study was conducted. Third, we aimed to identify AD biomarkers with GWAS data available. Subsequently, we evaluated the causal relationship of prior expressions on AD biomarkers to explore possible mechanisms. Finally, we assessed the potential side effects of targeting the prior druggable gene products for AD treatment via a phenome-  wide MR.

We also obtained a list of druggable genes from a review by Finan et al . 11\\n\\n## eQTL datasets\\n\\nThe discovery blood eQTL dataset was obtained from eQTLGen (https://eqtlgen.org/),  where  the  cis-  eQTLs  of  16  987  genes were obtained from 31  684 blood samples of healthy Europeanancestry  individuals.  Fully  significant  cis-  eQTL  results  (false discovery rate (FDR) &lt;0.05) and allele frequency information were obtained. The discovery brain eQTL data were obtained from  the  PsychENCODE  consortia  (http://resource.psychen -code.org), which included 1387 prefrontal cortex and primarily European samples. We downloaded all significant eQTLs (FDR &lt;0.05) for genes with expression of &gt;0.1 fragments per kilobase per million mapped fragments in at least 10 samples and all SNP information. Further details on the data are presented in online supplemental table S1 and in the original publications. 19 20\\n\\nIn addition, we used whole blood and brain frontal lobe ciseQTLs from the Genotype-  Tissue Expression project (GTEx) V .8 (https://gtexportal.org/home/datasets) to validate our findings. 21 Descriptions  of  donor  enrolment,  consent  process,  biospecimen procurement, sample fixation and other information are presented in online supplemental table S1 and on the website (https://www.gtexportal.org).\\n\\n## AD GWAS dataset\\n\\nThe outcome data used in this  study  were  obtained  from  the most recent and largest AD GWAS, which included 111  326 clinically diagnosed or 'proxy' AD cases and 677  663 controls. 22 It comprises various European GWAS consortia already working on AD and a new dataset collated from 15 European countries. The subgroups included in this GWAS are presented in online supplemental table S2 and more information is available in the original publication. 22 Moreover, a GWAS meta-  analysis of only clinically  diagnosed  AD  cases  (stage  I:  21  982  cases,  41  944 controls) 23 was  used  to  validate  our  findings  (online  supplemental table S2).\\n\\n## eQTL MR analysis\\n\\nMR analyses were performed using the R package T woSampleMR V.0.5.6. 24 The eQTLs of the drug genome were selected as the exposure data. To generate IVs, we selected SNPs with FDR of &lt;0.05 and within ±100 kb from each gene's transcriptional start site (TSS). 19 SNPs in each eQTL were then clumped at r 2 &lt;0.01 using  European  samples  from  the  1000  Genomes  Project. 24 25 The R package PhenoScanner V .1.0 was used to find IVs-  related phenotypes. Furthermore, we removed SNPs that were directly related to the outcome data (AD) and AD-  associated traits (eg, dementia and family history of AD). 26 The outcome data were then loaded and harmonised using the in-  built functions. The Wald ratio method was used to compute the MR estimates for each SNP . Where more than one SNP was available, a weighted mean of the ratio estimates,  weighted  by  the  inverse  variance of  the  ratio  estimates  (inverse-  variance  weighted,  IVW),  was used. We assessed whether the MR-Egger intercept significantly deviated from 0 to test horizontal pleiotropy when the number of SNPs is no less than three. Moreover, Cochran's Q methods were  used  to  test  for  heterogeneity  between  Wald  ratios. 27 FDR-  corrected  p  values  were  calculated,  and  FDR  of  &lt;0.05\\n\\nwas considered significant. In the replication studies, nominal p values of &lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant.\\n\\n## Colocalisation analysis\\n\\nOccasionally, an SNP is located in two or more gene regions. In this case, if an SNP contained eQTL information for two or more different genes, its effect on the disease (here, AD) would be mixed by different genes, and colocalisation analysis was used to  confirm  that  AD  and  the  eQTLs  may  share  causal  genetic variants.  Briefly,  for  significant  MR  results  in  the  discovery, we  performed  a  colocalisation  analysis  for  AD  risk  and  the SNP within ±100 kb from each gene's TSS in eQTL via the R package COLOC V .5.2.0 28 with  P 1 =1×10 -4 , P 2 =1×10 -4 and P 12 =1×10 -5 . The probability that a given SNP is linked to AD is denoted as P 1 ; the probability that a given SNP is a significant eQTL is denoted as P 2 ; and the probability that a given SNP is an outcome of both AD and eQTL is denoted as P 12 . The COLOC package was used to test five hypotheses. The posterior proba -bility (PP) was used to quantify support for all the hypotheses, and they were identified as PPH 0 -PPH 4 :  PPH 0 ,  no  association with either trait; PPH 1 ,  association with the expression of the gene but not the AD risk; PPH 2 , association with the AD risk but not the expression of the gene; PPH 3 , association with the AD risk and expression of the gene, with distinct causal variants; and PPH 4 , association with the AD risk and expression of the gene, with a shared causal variant. 28 We restricted our analysis to genes reaching  PPH 3 +PPH 4 of  ≥0.8  owing  to  limited  power  in  the colocalisation analysis. 28\\n\\n## Markers associated with AD\\n\\nTo  determine  whether  these  three  AD-  causal  genes  (epoxide hydrolase  2  ( EPHX2 ), SIGLEC11 and SERPINB1 )  which  we identified  in  our  study  via  MR  analysis  were  involved  in  the hypothetical pathological mechanism of AD, we first performed another set of two-  sample MR with the same MR parameters between the three identified genes' eQTL ( EPHX2 , SIGLEC11 and SERPINB1 )  in  the  brain  and  blood  and  the  hypothet -ical biomarkers to investigate the effect of gene expression on AD biomarkers. We then performed the second step using the markers' GWASs as exposures and the AD GWAS as the outcome to  explore  the  mediating  role.  The  biochemical  and  neuroimaging markers of AD were obtained from previous reviews 1 29 30 (online supplemental table S3).\\n\\n## Phenome-wide MR\\n\\nTo  study  the  potential  side  effects  of  these  three  prior  drug -gable genes, we used gene expression as exposure and summary statistics of diseases in the UK Biobank cohort (n≤408  961) as outcomes to perform phenome-  wide MR. Disease GWASs from the UK Biobank were performed using the Scalable and Accurate Implementation  of  Generalised  Mixed  Model  (SAIGE  V .0.29) method to account for unbalanced case-control ratios. 31 Owing to  statistical  power,  we  chose  783  traits  (diseases)  with  more than  500  cases  for  phenome-  MR  analyses.  Summary  statistics of  disease-  associated  SNPs  were  downloaded  from  the  SAIGE GWAS  (https://www.leelabsg.org/resources). 31 Further details are provided in the publication. 31 We then used the same parameters  to  perform  MR  analysis  using  the  prior  druggable  gene eQTL in the blood via the IVW method. The causal effects are considered statistically significant at FDR&lt;0.05.\\n\\n## RESULTS\\n\\n## Druggable genome\\n\\nUsing the data available in DGIdb v4.2.0, we identified 3953 genes  as  potentially  druggable  (online  supplemental  table  S4).\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nProtective Risk\\n\\nFigure 2 MR and colocalisation analysis results in the discovery phase.

Finally, 5883 unique druggable  genes  with  Human  Genome  Organisation  Gene Nomenclature Committee names were aggregated from the two sources  mentioned  above  for  further  analysis  (online  supple -mental table S6).\\n\\n## Candidate druggable genes for AD\\n\\nWe used eQTLs from the brain tissue and blood to intersect with druggable genes to obtain druggable eQTLs. All primitive significant brain eQTLs (FDR&lt;0.05) included 14 653 gene symbols after  removing  SNPs  beyond±100 kb  from  the  TSS.  When overlapping with the druggable genome, we obtained the brain druggable  eQTL  as  the  exposure,  which  included  4422  gene symbols.  After  the  SNPs  were  clumped,  3021  genes  remained to run the MR. After removing the SNPs directly related to AD, 21 candidate druggable genes for AD were identified following FDR adjustment (FDR &lt;0.05) using the Wald ratio or the IVW method (figure 2 ). The IVs for significant expression, PhenoS -canner  outcome,  and  full  results  of  the  MR  are  presented  in online supplemental table S7-9.\\n\\nRegarding blood eQTL, by running criteria similar to the brain eQTL, blood druggable eQTL exposure, including 2860 gene symbols, was obtained to perform MR. As a result, we found 12 potential  drug  targets  (figure  2  and  online  supplemental  table S10). In summary, 33 unique potential druggable genes for AD were identified in at least one dataset (brain and blood). Notably, three prior druggable genes ( EPHX2 , SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11 ) reached significant levels in the blood and brain tissues. They all showed risk influence on AD (in the brain, EPHX2 OR 1.27, SERPINB1 OR  1.41  and SIGLEC11 OR  1.12;  in  the  blood, EPHX OR 1.10, SERPINB1 OR 1.14 and SIGLEC11 OR 1.10, respectively).\\n\\nSubsequently, we  performed  a  colocalisation analysis to further determine the probability that SNPs associated with AD and eQTL shared causal genetic variants using the SNP within ±100 kb from the TSS of the 33 potential druggable genes. The results suggested that most identified genes and AD likely share a causal variant within the region (figure 2 and online supplemental table S11). For three prior genes, EPHX2 and SIGLEC11 produced  significant results  in  both  datasets  (PPH 3 +PPH 4 &gt;0.8), and SERPINB1 also reached significant levels in the blood (PPH 3 +PPH 4 =0.98) but not in the brain (PPH 3 +PPH 4 =0.42) in the further colocalisation analysis. When only the GWAS of clin -ically diagnosed AD was used, SIGLEC11 and SERPINB1 passed FDR of &lt;0.05 in the brain eQTL, and the FDR of SIGLEC11\\n\\nin the blood was very close to 0.05 (online supplemental table S12).\\n\\nAdditionally, during our replication, MR using whole blood and brain frontal lobe cis-  eQTL from GTEx V .8, 21 SIGLEC11 , SERPINB1 , LIMK2 , CD46 and ADAM10 showed  suggestive significance (p&lt;0.05) in either the blood or brain (online supple -mental table S13 and S14).\\n\\n## Association between AD druggable genes and markers\\n\\nPrevious reviews were screened to identify the biochemical and neuroimaging markers of AD. 1 29 Owing to the restricted GWAS data on AD markers, we only found the following markers with sufficient  data:  cerebrospinal  fluid  (CSF)  A β , 32 CSF  p-  tau, 32 circulating t-  tau, 33 total/right/left  hippocampal  volume, 34  35 cortical surface and thickness, 36 white matter hyperintensities 35 and  white  matter  integrity  (fractional  anisotropy  and  mean diffusivity). 37\\n\\nWe found that blood and brain EPHX2 may be associated with the whole hippocampal volume (unadjusted p values=0.019 and 0.0088, respectively; online supplemental table S15). However, no  association  was  identified  between  three  prior  druggable genes ( EPHX2 , SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11 )  and the aforementioned AD markers. In addition, using the marker GWAS as an exposure  and  AD  as  the  outcome,  we  observed  that  only  the whole  brain  surface  affected  the  AD  outcome  (unadjusted  p value=0.00869, online supplemental table S16).\\n\\n## Phenome-wide MR analysis of AD prior druggable genes\\n\\nBecause  most  drugs  function  through  blood  circulation,  we assessed  whether  the  three  AD-  associated  expressions  in  the blood had beneficial or deleterious effects on other indications. Therefore, we performed a broader MR screening of 783 non-  AD diseases  or  traits  in  the  UK  Biobank  (SAIGE  V .0.29,  online supplemental  table  S17). 31 Overall,  no  significant  association was identified (FDR &lt;0.05) using the IVW method ( figure 3), although we observed some trends. Higher blood EPHX2 levels may  potentially  benefit  hypertensive  chronic  kidney  disease (OR 0.73, p=0.00027) ( figure 3 and online supplemental table S18).  In  addition,  high  levels  of SERPINB1 caused  pituitary gland disorders and hypothalamic control (OR 1.67, p=0.0023) (figure 3 and online supplemental table S19). Blood SIGLEC11 levels were most likely associated with periapical abscesses (OR 0.74, p=0.0025) ( figure 3 and online supplemental table S20). No other diseases may be linked to these druggable genes that\\n\\nFigure 3 Manhattan plot for phenome-  wide MR results of blood EPHX2, SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11.

A  major  cause  for  this  dilemma  is  the  unknown pathophysiology of AD. In this study, based on blood and brain druggable eQTLs, we found 33 druggable gene expressions that may influence AD outcomes, 5 of which were also found in a repeated study. Indeed, our study provides robust evidence that three  genes  ( EPHX2 , SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11 )  are  causally associated with AD, and all show evidence of genetic colocalisation with AD outcomes. Furthermore, we found associations between EPHX2 and  whole  hippocampal  volume,  which  may provide potential clues to the pathological mechanisms involved in  AD.  In  addition,  phenome-  wide  MR  highlighted  additional beneficial indications of therapeutics targeting the three AD-  associated genes and indicated a few potential safety concerns.\\n\\nEPHX2 encodes a member of the epoxide hydrolase family, which  is  found  in  the  cytosol  and  peroxisomes.  It  binds  to specific  epoxides  and  converts  them  to  the  corresponding dihydrodiols. 38 Soluble  epoxide  hydrolase  (sEH)  expression  is elevated  in  the  hippocampus  of  AD  mice,  and  sEH  levels  are also  higher  in  the  brain  of  patients  with  AD  compared  with healthy  individuals. 39 In  pharmacological  studies,  the  genetic deletion of EPHX2 or the downregulation of sEH level reduces A β deposition in the brain of AD model mice, prevents astrocyte  reactivation  and  alleviates  cognitive  deficits. 39  40 Furthermore, a proteome-  wide association study integrating a smaller AD GWAS with the discovery  of  the  Religious  Orders  Study, Memory  and  Ageing  Project  brain  proteomes 41 and  a  nondruggable  genomic  MR  study  using  protein  quantitative  trait locus data 42 reported that EPHX2 might affect AD. Consistent with these results, we provide druggable genetic evidence for the directionally consistent effects of EPHX2 in the blood or brain tissue on AD outcomes. We also observed that higher levels of EPHX2 may  be  associated  with  lower  hippocampal  volume. More  importantly,  through  phenome-  wide  MR  analysis,  we observed  no  significant  side  effects  associated  with EPHX2 expression (online supplemental table S18). sEH expression is elevated in the AD hippocampus 39 40 ; whether the pathological accumulation of sEH accelerates hippocampal atrophy and leads to  AD  requires  further  research.  PF-  750,  a  drug  that  inhibits fatty acid amide hydrolase, weakly inhibits sEH. 43 However, this compound has not yet reached phase I clinical trials (preclinical/ research compound). Another drug, AR9281, may also interact with EPHX2 without a clear direction yet. 44 Overall, our results indicated that EPHX2 is a promising target for treating AD by affecting hippocampal volume. However, PF-  750 or compounds that target EPHX2 deserve further investigation.\\n\\nSerpin  family  B  member  1  ( SERPINB1 )  encodes  a  member of the serpin family of proteinase inhibitors,  maintaining homeostasis  by  neutralising  overexpressed  proteinase  activity through their function as suicide substrates. 45 A locus associated with  A β 42  within SERPINB1 on  chromosome  6p25  has  been reported to be associated with AD risk in a GWAS study. 46 A previous  study  indicated  that  the  intronic SERPINB1 variant rs316341 affects the expression of SERPINB1 in various tissues, including  the  hippocampus,  suggesting  that SERPINB1 may influence AD through an A β -associated mechanism. 46 In  addition, SERPINB1 is upregulated in patients with AD, 47 and higher levels of SERPINB1 expression in the prefrontal cortex are associated with higher levels of amyloidosis. 48 Our MR study also revealed that higher SERPINB1 levels increased the risk of AD. However, we found no association between SERPINB1 and AD biomarkers using MR in this study. Because of the unavailability\\n\\nof a large proportion of AD pathological marker GWAS data, negative  results  are  not  credible.  More  basic  experiments  and larger  GWAS  data  are  needed  to  determine  the  relationship between SERPINB1 and A β or other AD biomarkers. SERPINB1 is  the  only  druggable  gene  under  the  tier  3  B  term  (encoding secreted  or  extracellular  proteins,  proteins  with  more  distant similarity to approved drug targets and members of key drug -gable gene families not already included in tier 1 or 2) according to Finan et al . 11 Currently, there are no drugs with SERPINB1 as a clear target. Heparin from bovines is predicted to interact with SERPINB1 (www.noveseek.com); however, its exact role is unclear. Our phenome-  wide MR analysis showed that the associ -ation of the drug with blood SERPINB1 produced no side effects in other systems. Hence, drug development targeting SERPINB1 may be promising, and further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism of action of SERPINB1 on the risk of AD.\\n\\nSIGLEC11 ,  another robust AD-  associated gene identified in the present study, encodes a member of the sialic acid-  binding immunoglobulin-  like  lectin  family.  It  is  mainly  expressed  in peripheral  blood  leucocytes,  macrophages  and  microglia  and binds to an α -2-  8-  linked sialic acid. 49 It is a risk factor for AD. 50 SIGLEC11 may be associated with ceramide-  related inflamma -tion and anti-  inflammatory pathways in AD. 50 In addition to our findings, higher levels of SIGLEC11 may trigger an inflamma -tory response that can produce neurotoxic effects or promote the deposition of pathological proteins in AD, although the exact mechanism is unknown. Further investigation of SIGLEC11 in the context of AD is required.\\n\\nIn addition, the remaining expression products could provide further insights into anti-  AD drug discovery. When comparing the  MR  results  using  eQTLs  derived  from  the  two  cohorts, SIGLEC11 , SERPINB1 , LIMK2 , CD46 and ADAM10 were repeated in at least one tissue sample. LIMK2 regulates cortical development by regulating neural progenitor cell proliferation and migration. 51 Consistent with our findings, a previous study identified CD46 as significantly dysregulated in late-  onset AD. 52 Moreover, ADAM10 is  an  important enzyme in AD pathology and may function in AD via astrocytes. 53 2,4-  Diacetylphloroglucinol reduces A β production and secretion by regulating ADAM10 and its intracellular trafficking in cellular and animal models of AD. 54 Furthermore, the development of ADAM10 endocytosis inhib -itors  for  AD  treatment  yielded  promising  preclinical  results. 55 Therefore, multiple studies support the drug targets identified in our study.\\n\\nSince our primary objective was to provide genetic evidence to improve success rates in clinical trials for AD drug discovery, we decided to reduce the number of false positives. Therefore, we integrated two-  stage MR (discovery and validation) in blood and  brain  tissues  and  used  colocalisation  analysis  to  identify robust  druggable  genes.  We  removed  SNPs  directly  related  to AD and AD-  related diseases to prevent strengthening the MR findings using PhenoScanner. Finally, the three robust druggable genes were further analysed for AD biomarkers and phenomewide  MR.  The  strengths  of  our  study  include  the  following. Previously,  there  have  been  a  few  MR  studies  on  QTLs  and AD outcome 42 56 ;  however, we used the largest and latest AD GWAS, 22 and our MR study is the first to study druggable genes in  the  context  of  AD  and  AD  biomarkers.  There  were  few significant results between markers and AD when running MR; however,  we  cannot  exclude  the  association  between  markers and AD.\\n\\nOur study also has some limitations. First, the number of IVs in MR for eQTL is limited, and most are no more than three SNPs, which limits the level of confidence in the MR results. Because of  the  number  of  IVs,  we  only  ran  heterogeneity  and  pleiot -ropy analyses for MR between AD markers and AD outcomes but not for the MR-  involved eQTLs. Second, because the data were locked, many AD markers were not included in our study, such  as  neurofibrillary  tangles,  inflammatory  plaques,  soluble TREM2 and  positron  emission tomography images, leading to potential associations being missed. Third, the findings were not repeated at the protein level, considering that many genes did not have IVs after filtering the p value when we conducted a preliminary study. In addition, our initial findings were based on AD GWAS, including clinical and proxy cases. MR with proxy cases yields counterintuitive findings. 57 Nonetheless, SIGLEC11 and SERPINB1 reached  adjusted  significance  only  in  clinically diagnosed AD GWAS. This may be due to insufficient sample size  and  the  fact  that EHPX2 was  not  repeated.  Furthermore, it  is  difficult  to  determine  the  most  appropriate  tissue  for  AD discovery. The genes that reached significant levels in the blood and  brain  tissues  may  have  stronger  evidence.  Another  key limitation is that MR analysis cannot fully recapitulate clinical trials.  MR  analysis  differs  from  clinical  trials,  which  typically investigate  comparably  high  drug  doses  over  a  short  time. 14 Additionally,  the  GWASs  conducted  in  the  UK  Biobank  were restricted  to  Caucasians,  which  might  restrict  the  applicability of our findings to other groups and races. Moreover, although all participants in the UK Biobank were of European ancestry, geographical clustering was not adjusted in the original GWASs. It was reported that the health outcomes appear geographically structured and that coincident structure in health outcomes and genotype  data  can  yield  biased  associations  in  UK  Biobank. 58 Therefore, our results might be biased by population heteroge -neity in the UK Biobank. 58 Future studies with participants from the  same  region  were  worthy  to  be  performed.  Furthermore, we  only  explored  the  side  effects  of EHPX2 , SIGLEC11 and SERPINB1 eQTL in diseases from the UK Biobank. However, the effects of drugs on their targets are quite extensive, and many off-  target effects cannot be explored using MR. Further exploration is required through subsequent basic and clinical trials to gain a more comprehensive understanding. Finally, there were not as many approved drugs as expected, making it difficult to study new uses of the old drugs; however, we found three robust druggable genes.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n\\nThis study found three robust druggable genes ( EPHX2 , SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11 )  and  30  candidate  druggable  genes for  AD.  In  addition,  AD  biomarkers  and  phenome-  wide  MR analyses of EPHX2 , SERPINB1 and SIGLEC11 were conducted. In summary, we provide genetic evidence supporting the poten -tial therapeutic benefits of three druggable genes for AD, which will be useful for prioritising AD drug development.\\n\\nAcknowledgements The authors thank the patients with AD in the included studies and all the researchers.\\n\\nContributors W-  MS: conception, methodology, analysis and writing of the manuscript; J-  XG: methodology, analysis and validation; MD, Q-  QD, ZJ, K-  FY and W-  CC: validation; BC and YW: validation and supervision of the project; Y-  PC: wrote, revised, discussed the final edition and responsible for the overall content; all authors read and approved the final version of the manuscript.\\n\\nFunding This study was supported the National Key Research and Development Program of China (grant number 2022YFC2703101 to YPC), the National Natural Science Fund of Sichuan (grant number 2022NSFSC0749 to BC), the Science and Technology Bureau Fund of Sichuan Province (grant number 2023YFS0269 to YPC), the National Natural Science Fund of China (grant number 81971188 to YPC) and the 1·3·5 Project for Disciplines of Excellence, Clinical Research Fund, West China Hospital, Sichuan University (grant number 2023HXFH032 to YPC).\\n\\n## Cognition\\n\\nCompeting interests None declared.\\n\\nPatient consent for publication Not applicable.\\n\\nEthics approval Not applicable.\\n\\nProvenance and peer review Not commissioned; externally peer reviewed.\\n\\nData availability statement Data are available in a public, open access repository.

AD is a complex and multifactorial disease that is responsible for 60-80% of dementia cases. Aging, genetic factors, and epigenetic changes are the main risk factors for AD. Two aggregation-prone proteins play a decisive role in AD pathogenesis: β -amyloid (A β ) and hyperphosphorylated tau (pTau). Both of them form deposits and diffusible toxic aggregates in the brain. These proteins are the biomarkers of AD. Different hypotheses have tried to explain AD pathogenesis and served as platforms for AD drug research. Experiments demonstrated that both A β and pTau might start neurodegenerative processes and are necessary for cognitive decline. The two pathologies act in synergy. Inhibition of the formation of toxic A β and pTau aggregates has been an old drug target. Recently, successful A β clearance by monoclonal antibodies has raised new hopes for AD treatments if the disease is detected at early stages. More recently, novel targets, e.g., improvements in amyloid clearance from the brain, application of small heat shock proteins (Hsps), modulation of chronic neuroinflammation by different receptor ligands, modulation of microglial phagocytosis, and increase in myelination have been revealed in AD research.\\n\\nKeywords: Alzheimer's disease; toxic amyloids; A β ; tau; genetics; amyloid clearance; vascular dysfunction; neuroinflammation; heat shock proteins; drug targets\\n\\n## 1. Introduction\\n\\nNeurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) represent a big part of neurological disorders. NDDs are characterized by the loss of synapses and neurons in the central nervous system (CNS). Neuronal loss often generates the decline of cognitive functions and dementia. Many NDDshave a common central neuropathological event: misfolded, toxic protein aggregates (amyloids) are accumulated in the CNS. NDDs can be regarded as protein homeostasis disorders: the level of several aggregation-prone proteins is increased, and subsequent small conformational changes result in the accumulation of pathogenic, β -structured amyloid proteins. Many amyloid protein structures are self-replicating, display prionoid character, and their aggregated form is propagated from cell to cell (transmissible pathology) [1]. The prionoid propagation of several amyloids (e.g., tau protein and α -synuclein) has been proven. The precise molecular mechanism of the conversion of a nontransmissible protein to the pathogenic prionoid form is not completely understood. Although the native, functionally-folded proteins possess important physiological functions, their misfolded amyloid aggregates are toxic to brain cells. The amyloid structure fundamentally differs from the globular state of these proteins and has remarkable similarities in the molecular and supramolecular organization [2].

Amyloid accumulation may also occur in the parenchymal organs of the periphery (e.g., heart and kidneys) and cause the progress of serious diseases. Existing treatments for NDDs are limited and mainly address symptoms rather than causes of the disease. Very recent studies have shown that these diseases are complex and multifactorial, presenting hurdles for discovering novel therapies. In the recent genomic era, novel experimental results have opened up the opportunity for using genetic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomics, and lipidomic data for designing novel drugs for the treatment of NDDs. Developing preventive and, ultimately, disease-modifying therapies for slowing the progression of neurodegeneration in AD and other NDDs seems to be one of the greatest medical needs of our time.\\n\\nThe present review first summarizes our most important knowledge of AD (pathology, genetic background, different hypotheses of the progression of AD, and novel methods for early diagnosis). In the second part, we show novel targets for preventing and/or slowing the progress of AD (e.g., increase in amyloid clearance, inhibition of amyloid formation and accumulation, and modulation of neuroinflammation).\\n\\n## 2. Alzheimer's Disease\\n\\n## 2.1. Pathology and Classification of AD. Aging and Dementia. The Main Risk Factors of AD\\n\\nPresently, AD is an incurable and progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by mixed proteinopathy, progressive dysfunction and loss of synapses, behavioral dysfunction, memory loss, and rapid cognitive decline [4]. Clinicopathologically, AD is a heterogeneous, multifactorial disease with different pathobiological subtypes. AD is rather a spectrum, a continuum from the preclinical, asymptotic phase via mild cognitive impairment to severe AD dementia [4]. Extremely complex, interrelated, and destructive processes lead to cell death and dementia. Novel strategies emphasize the importance of multitarget therapies for AD treatment due to the heterogeneity of the disease [5].\\n\\nExcellent reviews based on the results of systematic postmortem analyses summarize the pathology of AD [5-9]. The two most important pathological hallmarks of AD brains were described by A. Alzheimer in 1907. These are the formation of extracellular A β deposits (plaques) and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Different A β deposits have been found in the brain and cognitively normal individuals. The distribution of amyloid plaques represents the major difference between cognitively normal individuals and AD patients. All types of cerebral, nonvascular A β deposits are referred to as 'senile plaques.' Cerebral A β deposition shows different phases [10]. Diffuse plaques occur in brain regions in β -amyloidosis at early stages, and cored neuritic plaques only occur in later stages of A β deposition. Diffuse plaques appear in all phases of deposition. The presence of diffuse plaques is not coupled to AD, while neuritic plaques have been shown to be associated with dementia. A β deposits mainly have a complex structure that contains several coaggregating proteins (Apolipoprotein E: APOE, Cathepsin D, and Clusterin), as well as dystrophic neurites and microglia. Other morphological hallmarks are vascular amyloid deposits, neuroinflammation, neuronal loss, and astrogliosis.\\n\\nAD is classified into early onset (EOAD) and late-onset (LOAD) forms. Both forms possess common pathological features. The symptoms appear before the age of 65 in EOAD and after 65 in LOAD. The different clinical forms of AD have been classified into four subtypes based on the distribution of tau pathology and neuronal loss: typical, minimal atrophy, limbic predominant, and hippocampal spearing subtypes. Deposition of A β to extracellular plaques follows different pathways and shows distinct patterns. The specific pattern of tau pathology correlates better than that of A β deposition with the clinical symptoms of AD patients (cognitive impairment and memory loss). AD starts when both amyloid and tau pathologies overlap [11]. Several other heterogeneous AD variants have\\n\\nrecently been identified based on the atrophy of different neuronal networks. Age-related copathologies are also frequent (e.g., Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis), which makes it difficult to understand the pathomechanism of AD in individual cases [9].\\n\\nThe neuropathological staging of AD was already performed in 1991 [12] based on the development of tau (NFT) pathology in the brain (stages I to VI). Braak stages show some correlation to the clinically observed severity of dementia. Thal and coworkers demonstrated that the spreading of amyloid deposits in the brain could be predicted and occurs in five stages [13]. A β plaques appear in the neocortex in phase 1 (cognitive functions, working memory, speech perception, and language skill). Later, A β deposition also occurs in allocortical brain regions (phase 2). Subcortical areas (striatum and basal cholinergic forebrain nuclei) are involved in further depositions (phase 3). In phase 4, several brainstem nuclei (vital functions and relaying neuronal impulses) are affected by the deposition of a high density of plaques, and their level is in good correlation with the symptoms of dementia. Finally, phase 5 is characterized by amyloid depositions in the cerebellum (movement coordination). Biomarkers can monitor the deposition of A β plaques and tau in living patients. These studies demonstrate that A β and tau pathologies already start decades before symptoms of cognitive decline in AD patients (biomarkerbased diagnosis of the preclinical stage, see Section 2.5).\\n\\nADis the most common cause of dementia. Although the basic pathophysiological mechanism of AD is not yet clear, many indications address the importance of aging, as well as genetic and environmental factors. Aging seems to be the most important risk factor of AD ('the neurobiology of aging and AD is walking down the same road') [6]. Some of the hallmarks of aging (e.g., mitochondrial dysfunction, low-grade chronic inflammation, and loss of proteostasis) overlap with the hallmarks of AD. Aging, genetic background, and epigenetic changes are the main risk factors for AD.\\n\\nNormal aging of the brain induces many changes. There are gross and microscopic alterations in the brain structure and metabolism (e.g., volume loss, demyelination, enlargement of ventriculi, dysfunction of the cholinergic system, decreased ligand binding affinity of several receptors, alteration in gene expression, a decrease in synaptic function, lipofuscin accumulation, disturbances of the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) function, an increase in cellular waste, etc.) [14]. Tissue atrophy, alteration in certain neurotransmitters, and dyshomeostasis of the cellular environment accompany normal aging and ultimately result in cognitive decline [14].\\n\\nDementia, a common sign of NDDs, is not a part of normal aging. It is very different from the cognitive decline that manifests during normal aging. Dementia is a syndrome of acquired, progressive cognitive impairment, frequently accompanied by depression, loss of memory, orientation, etc., which symptoms result in disruption of basic self-care. There are several modifiable risk factors for dementia, e.g., smoking, diabetes, obesity, depression, and physical inactivity [15].\\n\\nAging is accompanied by more and more frequent misfolding and aggregation of proteins [16,17]. Active balancing of protein synthesis and degradation are critical processes in the cells [18]. An adaptive network of functions called protein quality control (PQC) has evolved over millions of years to maintain cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis). Different chaperones (e.g., heat shock proteins, Hsps) control the correct folding and aggregation of proteins. The vulnerability of the aging brain tissue may be demonstrated by the presence of suboptimal levels of proteostasis components (low levels of aggregation protectors and high levels of aggregation promoters) [19]. If PQC fails, a misfolding process results in the formation of pathogenic aggregates that are divided into two groups: unordered amorphous and rather ordered fibrillar amyloids [16]. Several disease-related amyloids (e.g., β -amyloid peptides) possess a high propensity for irreversible aggregation. It has been uncovered that age-dependent protein aggregation is a common feature of aging [17]. Structural alteration of the peptidic backbone might be one of the reasons for protein aggregation [20]. Spontaneous isomerization and epimerization of the aspartyl residue to D-Asp and L- and D-isoAsp results in modified protein structures with high\\n\\nprotease resistance [21,22]. Hundreds of proteins become highly insoluble during the aging process [23]. Results of systematic postmortem analysis of AD brains demonstrated that two amyloid proteins play a decisive role in the development of AD: A β (mainly the 1-40 and 1-42 amino acid peptides) and pTau (see Section 2.3).\\n\\n## 2.2. Genetic Background of AD, the Multiplex Model\\n\\nBoth forms of AD show high heritability [24]. The estimated heritability is over 90% for EOAD, and it is in the range of 60-80% for LOAD. Mutations in the amino acid sequence of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and presenilin (PS) genes (presenilin 1 and 2 proteins are important for APP processing to A β ) are causative factors for EOAD [8]. About 60 highly penetrant APP mutations have been discovered that are involved in the progress of EOAD. (Interestingly, a protective mutation of APP that decreases A β aggregation was found in the Iceland population [25]). PSEN mutations are responsible for 80% of EOAD cases. Over 350 mutations have been identified so far. The amyloid hypothesis is based on the strong genetic evidence of EOAD and Down syndrome. Altered APP processing and A β overproduction are in the background of AD.\\n\\nThe genetics of LOAD is much more complex than that of EOAD, and it is the result of combined influences of multiple genetic loci or polygenic effects. Genetic studies have demonstrated that AD is a multicomponent disease [26]. Until 2020, over 50 genetic risk factors have been identified that are responsible for LOAD (multiplex model of AD) [26]. APOE4 was proven to be the strongest single risk factor for LOAD (cholesterol synthesis and transport). It has recently been demonstrated that ApoE4 significantly increases tau pathogenesis and tau-associated neurodegeneration. Global ApoE deficiency is strongly protective [27]. Very recently, it was found that deletion of neuronal ApoE4 drastically reduces tau pathology in pTau overproducing PS19-ED mice [28]. These studies provide evidence that ApoE4 influences a multitude of events in AD progression (A β and tau accumulation, neuronal hyperexcitability, and myelin deficits). It was also reported that ApoE4 does not directly drive neurodegeneration, but microglia may mediate the effect of ApoE4 [29]. Interestingly, the majority of the genes/loci are associated with immune functions. For example, the TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2) gene was identified to play a key role in microglia and macrophage function [30]. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) enable the study of tens of thousands of patients and millions of genetic variations [31]. A two-stage GWAS was performed with 111,326 clinically diagnosed AD patients and 677,663 control individuals [32]. In these studies, 75 AD risk loci were found, of which 42 were new. Over 130 AD-associated loci were identified by GWAS, among them APOE4, TREM2, CR1, CD33, CLU, BIN1, CD2AP, PICALM, SORL1, SP11, RIN3, and more genes in another study [33]. Pathway analysis methods were used for studying genomic associations for identifying disease-relevant processes [33]. It was found that the majority of the genes are associated with immune functions. According to the multiplex model, besides immunity and inflammation, other pathways (for example, endocytosis, cholesterol metabolism and transport, A β clearance, tau processing, autophagy, and vascular factors) also participate in AD initiation. Genetic approaches have provided the first convincing evidence that the immune system plays a decisive role in the progression of AD.\\n\\nBeyond inherited genetics, somatic mutations and diverse epigenetic mechanisms (DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and long, noncoding RNAs) may participate in aging and neurodegeneration of the brain [34].\\n\\n## 2.3. Amyloid Structures. Physiological and Pathophysiological Role of the A b and Tau Proteins\\n\\nAmyloidogenic processing of APP provides a heterogeneous mixture of A β peptides of 37 to 43 amino acids. The physiological (neuroprotective) role of the monomeric A β 1-42 peptide has been widely reviewed [35-37]. Very recently, a Special Issue of Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience has been published dealing with the physiological and pathological role of A β in detail [38].\\n\\nMonomeric A β 1-42 is a neuropeptide, a physiological neuroprotector. A β 1-42 regulates synaptic function, neural circuitry, organelle trafficking, neurogenesis, neuroinflammation, and cognitive processes in picomolar concentrations [38]. A β 1-42 in low concentration suppresses microbial infections and can seal leaks in the blood-brain barrier, BBB ('vascular plug') [37,39]. In physiological concentrations, A β maintains angiogenesis and vascularization, protects the BBB, promotes recovery after brain injury, and acts as a tumor suppressor [39]. A β can be produced intracellularly by APP cleavage. External A β can enter the cells by receptor-mediated internalization [40]. A β monomers start to aggregate into different A β oligomers over a critical concentration [41]. Intracellular A β also participates in neurodegenerative processes [42]. The aggregation process provides different A β assemblies; in the first step, oligomers (oA β ):\\n\\nnative A β monomer → partially folded monomer → transient oA β → protofibrils ( β -sheet → structured oA β → fibrils (crossβ ) → big aggregates, plaques.\\n\\nAmyloid aggregation has been experimentally studied under in vivo conditions [43]. Amyloid proteins interact with other proteins (cross-seeding) [44]. It was found that cross-seeding plays a key role in amyloid formation. Lipids (e.g., gangliosides and cholesterol) and divalent metal ions (e.g., zinc, copper, and iron) are good nucleators for A β (Section 2.4) [45]. Experiments (TEM studies of A β aggregates) demonstrated that several D-amino acids (D-Ala, D-Phe, D-Glu, and D-Asp) and DL-selenoMet initiate A β aggregation (enantiomeric-induced aggregation [46]). Most of the L-amino acids did not affect amyloid aggregation. Selenium nanoparticles inhibited enantiomeric-induced amyloid aggregation and could be beneficial compounds for AD treatment.\\n\\nIt was demonstrated that protein insolubility and aggregation might be critical for mediating the pathogenesis of NDDs in older ages. Thus, inhibition of the aggregation process seems to be a good target of drug design against NDDs. The very recent development of techniques, such as cryo-EM (cryo-electron microscopy), solid-state NMR (solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance), and AFM (atomic force microscopy), has opened up new ways of understanding amyloid structure [2,47]. Cryo-EM data can be integrated into comparative morphometric AFM image analysis of amyloid fibrils [48]. Cryo-EM studies demonstrated the complex structure and peptide conformation of A β fibrils isolated from the brain of AD patients [49-51].\\n\\nAnimal studies demonstrate that oA β is sufficient and necessary for AD-associated neurodegeneration [52,53]. A β oligomers have toxic effects on the brain [41]). They were shown to inhibit axonal transport, cause synaptic damage and dysfunction of neuronal plasticity, Ca 2+ -dyshomeostasis, oxidative stress, ER stress (endoplasmic reticulum stress), and selective neuronal death. One of the most important effects of oA β is the promotion of tau-hyperphosphorylation. Oligomeric A β interacts with the lipid membrane components (e.g., ganglioside GM1) and directly binds to different receptors [54]. Not all the binding proteins are genuine receptors since A β has an intrinsically disordered structure and can associate with many proteins.\\n\\nThe most important pathogenic events induced by toxic oA β are (1) stimulation of tau-hyperphosphorylation, (2) impairment of mitochondrial function, (3) disruption of Ca 2+ and protein homeostasis, and (4) induction of autophagy dysfunction. [40].\\n\\nAnother key player in AD progression is the tau protein. Alternative splicing of the human microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT) gene provides six tau isoforms, which may aggregate into oligomers and filaments [41]. Tau shows a large number of post-translational modifications [55].\\n\\nThe physiological role of tau proteins is widely reviewed [56,57]. As a multifunctional protein, tau plays an important role in physiological processes [41,58]. Tau participates in maintaining DNA integrity, protects and regulates microtubules and axonal transport, interacts with cytoskeletal proteins (e.g., actin and spectrin), and regulates the shape of the cells [39]. Native tau is necessary for normal myelination and also regulates transcription at the cell nucleus. Tau is also a synaptic protein. Very recently, it has been demonstrated that tau plays a basic role in accelerating spine formation, dendritic elongation, and synaptic\\n\\nplasticity [59]. Native tau modulates NMDA (N-methyl-D-Aspartate) receptor signaling and influences intracellular Ca 2+ levels. Native tau is a highly soluble protein and not prone to aggregation in its monomeric form. Phosphorylation of tau proteins in specific sites (Thr 231 and Ser 235, 262, 293, 324, and 356) results in the formation of pathological hyperphosphorylated proteins. In a cellular model, A β addition was shown to catalyze tau-hyperphosphorylation via activation of protein kinases DYRK1 and Fyn. Hyperphosphorylated tau dissociates from the microtubules and forms toxic assemblies:\\n\\nabnormally phosphorylated monomer (pTau) → dimer, trimer → small soluble oligomers (oTau) → granular oligomers → straight filaments → paired helical filaments → neurofibrillary tangles.\\n\\nThe monomeric form, filaments, and tangles are probably not toxic; however, the diffusible oligomers are toxic [60]. Recently, several cryo-EM studies have revealed the structure and peptide chain conformation of the helical filaments isolated from an AD brain at the atomic level [61].\\n\\nHyperphosphorylated tau aggregates possess several pathophysiological actions:\\n\\n- Disaggregation and collapse of microtubules. Big tau assemblies may cause a direct physical blockade of axonal transport.\\n- Loss of DNA protection at the nucleus.\\n- Increased excitability of neurons.\\n- Tau may bind to synaptic vesicles and disrupt the synaptic cytoskeleton causing synaptic loss and disturbances of neural circuits.\\n- Tau causes neuroinflammation.\\n- Prion-like propagation: tau is able to spread cell to cell, most likely via macropinocytosis and not by receptor support [62]. Several authors propose that AD may be an infectious disease of the brain [63].\\n\\nIt is widely accepted that A β and tau proteins have a synergistic effect in the progression of AD: 'A β is the trigger and tau is the bullet driving AD' [64,65]. It has recently been demonstrated that the presence of both A β and tau is necessary for memory decline at the beginning of AD [66]. A β and tau crosstalk shows that the two proteins are coupled in the progression of AD.\\n\\n## 2.4. The Ever-Changing and Developing Amyloid (and Tau) Hypotheses. Alternative Hypotheses of AD\\n\\nThe importance and complexity of AD triggered the elaboration of a very large number of hypotheses dealing with the pathogenesis of the disease. Strong neuropathological and genetic evidence support the mainstream concept of the amyloid hypothesis of AD. According to the hypothesis, an imbalance in the production and clearance of A β results in its overproduction and formation of toxic amyloid assemblies. A β accumulation and deposition are the critical initial steps, the central events, and driving factors of the progress of AD [67]. Synaptic loss, chronic neuroinflammation, microgliosis, astrocytosis, neuritic dystrophy, tau-hyperphosphorylation, and formation of NFTs are the consequences of amyloid deposits. The hypothesis has been changed several times over the decades. Originally, the amyloid plaques were proposed to be the culprits of the disease [67], followed by hypothesizing such a role for A β oligomers [68]. Although inconsistencies and controversies have been observed, the hypothesis has received continuous support for three decades in the field of AD drug development.\\n\\nSeveral experimental studies demonstrated that a pool of intracellular A β exists in the brain at the very early stage of AD that may interact with subcellular organelles, thereby affecting their normal function [69]. Novel evidence has suggested that extracellular A β has a small impact on AD pathology, and the plaques alone cannot be responsible for the whole pathological process [70]. The 'intracellular A β (iA β ) hypothesis' assumes that accumulation of iA β in the brain cells is the earliest sign of AD. The toxic iA β assemblies trigger tau pathology and the formation of NFTs. The formation of extracellular plaques\\n\\nonly occurs at later stages of the disease [71,72]. Indeed, a series of experiments have proven the formation and accumulation of iA β , e.g., observation of iA β by light and fluorescent microscopy, as well as by EM [73]. iA β is selectively resistant to enzymic degradation and accumulates in a nonfibrillar form in lysosomes [74]. The release of lysosomal proteases is one of the earliest events of iA β neurotoxicity [75].\\n\\nThe tau hypothesis . Several studies have demonstrated that tau hyperphosphorylation and NFT formation are early events in the development of AD. It was found that pTau cannot bind to the microtubules aggregates to NFTs after truncation of the polypeptide chains [76]. NFTs are toxic and shift APP processing to elevated A β production. Experiments demonstrated that pTau is a self-propagating protein with a prionoid character, spreading from cell to cell [77]. The tau (or tau-propagation) hypothesis proposes that pTau dissociates from the microtubules and aggregates to NFTs; this process precedes A β plaque formation and drives AD development. It was observed that tau pathology in the brain showed a good correlation with cognitive decline. Moreover, the formation of pTau proved to be the common pathway of different, altered molecular signals [70,78]. According to the tau hypothesis, pTau plays a central role in AD and is the diagnostic and therapeutic target of AD research. Indeed, a shift from the physiological to the pathological level of tau was observed in AD synapses [79].\\n\\nMost attempts to develop A β -targeted drugs for treating AD ended in failure for many years. As a consequence, an inevitable discussion, or rather a debate, started, whether misfolded A β or tau amyloids are the culprits, upstream pathogenic causes for driving AD progress. The problems of the amyloid hypothesis in understanding the pathomechanism of LOAD led to a change in the target of drug research from A β to tau. However, the experiments with the GSK-3 enzyme inhibitors, such as tideglusib and anti-aggregating agents (methylene blue derivatives: Trx0014 and LMTM), resulted in controversial results, and, thus, did not support the tau hypothesis. As A β and tau have neuroprotective effects, it is possible that their overproduction is only a protective response to cellular stress and damage.\\n\\nSeveral research groups tried to unify the two hypotheses [79-81]. The 'dual pathway hypothesis' of Small and Duff tried to reconcile the two hypotheses. Other research groups 'revitalized' the tau hypothesis and provided an integrative model of AD pathogenesis [82]. However, the debate has not ended yet.\\n\\nThe metal ion hypothesis connects the two main Alzheimer's hypotheses. Several transition metal ions participate in physiological processes. They play important roles in the maintenance of brain functions and may regulate the development of AD [83]. Postmortem analysis of amyloid plaques demonstrated the accumulation of copper, iron, and zinc by 5.7, 2.8, and 3.1 times compared to the levels of normal brains, respectively [81]. Heavy metal ions can be bound to the His residues of A β (His6, His13, and His14) and to pTau [84]. Metal ion imbalance induces A β and tau pathologies [85]. Zinc, copper, and iron ions enhance the production of A β and subsequently bind to A β and tau, promoting their aggregation. The misbalance of these metal ions is connected to the main factors of the pathogenesis of AD (oxidative stress, protein aggregation, mitochondrial dysfunction, energy deficiency, and neuroinflammation) [86]. Accumulation of iron and copper ions can promote cell death by ferroptosis or cuprostosis [87]. Therefore, metal ion chelators as therapeutic agents have been used for treating AD (Section 3). Metal ion chelators are also potential drug candidates for modulating neuroinflammation in AD.\\n\\nIn addition to the above processes, many other factors can affect the occurrence of AD. The results of novel experiments with rhesus monkeys connect the tau and glutamatergic dysregulation hypothesis [88]. Accordingly, vulnerable glutamatergic neurons are responsible for Ca 2+ -dysregulation, and this event induces the formation of pTau and NFTs. As a consequence, tau pathology might be the key initiating factor for LOAD and suggests that future AD drugs should reduce tau pathology.\\n\\nThe most detailed hypothesis of the initiation and progress of AD was introduced by De Strooper and Karran [89]. The AD continuum includes three stages. First, clearance\\n\\nproblems and proteostasis failure lead to abnormal A β and tau formation (biochemical phase). Several genes participate in this process (e.g., APOE4, LRP1, ABCA7, SORL 1, PICALM, and AQP4). In the second phase, each type of brain cell (neurons, microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, the glioneuronal unit, and the neurovascular unit) participates in the progress of degeneration (cellular phase). These changes result in chronic neuroinflammation, chronic imbalances in neuronal circuitry, cell failure, and cell death. The clinical phase is characterized by hippocampal shrinkage, MRI changes in the brain, alterations of CSF, and dementia. The whole process may take two to three decades.\\n\\nThe history and development of the various AD hypotheses and clinical trials have been excellently reviewed in [90]. The short list of the hypotheses is as follows:\\n\\n1. A β , very probably iA β , is the initiating factor of AD [66].\\n2. Loss of cholinergic neurons and neurotransmission are causing factors of AD [91].\\n3. Deficit of the glutamatergic system [88] triggers tau overproduction.\\n4. Abnormal phosphorylation of tau proteins is in the background of AD initiation and progress [76].\\n5. According to the dual cascade hypothesis, cellular processes in the brain cortex simultaneously drive tau and A β pathology [80].\\n6. Metal ion hypothesis: several transition metal ions accelerate amyloid aggregation [84,85].\\n7. Mitochondrial dysfunction starts a cascade of pathological events in brain cells [92].\\n8. Chronic neuroinflammation is responsible for the initiation of damage to neurons [93].\\n9. According to the vascular dysfunction hypothesis, impaired brain circulation and endothelial-mediated processes play central roles in AD pathogenesis [94,95].\\n10. Impaired amyloid clearance (BBB and glymphatic clearance) is the main cause of amyloid accumulation in AD [96].\\n11. A β peptides are generated in the periphery and enter the brain via the BBB [97].\\n12. Aging is the main driver of sporadic AD pathogenesis. Each type of brain cell (microglia, astrocytes, and brain vasculature cells) participates in pathophysiological events [89].\\n\\nWe propose that distinct hypotheses might be valid and applicable to understanding the pathology of different forms of AD. In EOAD, the priority of A β has already been demonstrated. Well-known mutations of APP, PS1, and PS2 are responsible for the formation of toxic A β species, and the familial disease shows autosomal dominant inheritance [98]. The other form of AD, LOAD, is a very heterogeneous disease. It is very probable that not only toxic A β can initiate the formation of the 'bullet' via tau hyperphosphorylation and NFT formation [64]. Experimental and clinical data have resulted in the consensus that AD is an amyloid-provoked tauopathy. It is agreed that both A β and pTau are necessary for cognitive decline [66]. Tau-originated toxic NFT is the common pathway in all subtypes of AD [78]. It can be accepted that either pTau or NFTs alone are able to start AD pathology, e.g., after dysfunction of the glutamatergic system or other stress conditions [88]. However, experimental evidence demonstrates that A β (very probably iA β , which seems to be the earliest sign of pathological events in AD) is the primary factor in starting AD progress in most cases. Figure 1 shows a short summary of the diversity of the possible initiating factors and the pathophysiological processes resulting in cellular dyshomeostasis and cell death.\\n\\n, x FOR PEER REVIEW\\n\\nFigure 1.

A very early diagnosis may facilitate preventive pharmacological and nonpharmacological treatments before dementia manifests.\\n\\nFinding and validating standard clinical diagnostic biomarkers is not an easy task, partly owing to the complexity of AD. The diagnostic process has several subsequent steps from detection of cognitive impairment until treatment (laboratory tests, genotyping, neurological examination, cognitive and functional tests, then brain structural imaging, CSF and blood biomarker analysis, and finally diagnosis) [100]. Prediction of AD progression would be essential for planning treatment and medication. However, it has remained a challenging task so far. It is supposed that AD can be diagnosed based only on biomarker abnormalities [101]. In other words, AD diagnosis can be based purely on biology, without cognitive tests.

Brain imaging and fluid biomarker analysis are the most frequently used assays for the detection and staging of the disease. During the last decade, there was a great development in the field of neuroimaging [103]. Precise detection of both A β and tau in the blood and brain are essential tools for AD diagnosis. The leading neuroimaging methods have been PET and MRI; less frequently used are CT and SPECT, the latter being a nuclear imaging technique [104]. Functional MRI (fMRI) indirectly measures brain activity and the integrity of brain networks in the MCI stage. Multimodal MRI can be effectively used for the prediction of AD progress [103]. The application and evaluation of different tau biomarkers (tau-PET, CSF- and blood-based markers) have been recently Diagnostic tools [102]. Brain imaging and fluid biomarker analysis are the most frequently used assays for the detection and staging of the disease. During the last decade, there was a great development in the field of neuroimaging [103]. Precise detection of both A β and tau in the blood and brain are essential tools for AD diagnosis. The leading neuroimaging methods have been PET and MRI; less frequently used are CT and SPECT, the latter being a nuclear imaging technique [104]. Functional MRI (fMRI) indirectly measures brain activity and the integrity of brain networks in the MCI stage. Multimodal MRI can be effectively used for the prediction of AD progress [103]. The application and evaluation of different tau biomarkers (tau-PET, CSF- and blood-based markers) have been recently\\n\\nreviewed [105]. The use of second-generation tau-PET tracers improved our understanding of the heterogeneity of AD and helped for staging the disease. The application of brain imaging techniques is reviewed in the World Alzheimer Report 2021 [106].\\n\\nIt is not rare that cognitively normal patients have degeneration in the cholinergic white matter [107,108]. It is assumed that the integrity of cholinergic pathways might be a good indicator of early changes in AD progress. Individuals without cognitive decline but possessing abnormal A β and tau PET images (plaques and NFTs) are also at a high risk of AD[109]. When both A β and tau are present in the brain, it can no longer be considered a risk factor but rather a diagnosis [105]. Other approaches, such as electroencephalography (EEG), have also been used for early diagnosis of MCI and AD [110].\\n\\nThe levels of fluid biomarkers of AD (mostly A β and tau) can be measured in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood. CSF analysis has a disadvantage: it needs invasive treatment (lumbar punction). The routine analytical methods are quantitative measurements of A β 1-42, pTau 181, and the ratio of pTau 181/A β 1-42 by immunoassay [111,112]. CSF concentration of A β peptides can also be measured by the automated tandem mass spectrometry method (HPLC-MS/MS) [113]. The U.S. FDA has recently granted marketing approval for a novel CSF-test (Lumipulse G-amyloid ratio(1-42/1-40) as a cheap alternative to PET for early detection of amyloid accumulation in AD brains [114]). (The A β 1-42/1-40 ratio in CSF strongly correlates with the PET status of the brain).\\n\\nThe application of a new blood test, a not complicated binding assay, has recently been published for very early detection of soluble toxic A β peptides (SOBA) [115]. Further studies should demonstrate the suitability of the SOBA method for identifying patients at risk of cognitive decline. Parallel work was performed for the detection of A β oligomers in mouse brains using a new PET-tracer (a 64 Cu-labeled aza-peptide) [116]. This approach gave unbelievably early detection of oA β increase compared to the standard 11 C-PET method.\\n\\nAradical improvement in blood tests for AD diagnosis has been developed [117]. It was demonstrated that measuring the levels of multiple blood biomarkers (pTau 231; pTau 231 and A β 42/40 together) was sufficient for identifying AD pathology. Blood tests were performed with a group of 242 patients and repeated for up to 6 years, along with MRI and cognitive testing. Evaluation of the experimental data gave interesting results: only pTau 217 was related to typical AD pathology over the 6-year testing period. Thus, pTau 217 may be an ideal biomarker in the clinical phases of AD for monitoring disease progression and the protective effects of drug candidates. 'The novel blood test will revolutionize the diagnosis of AD' [117].\\n\\n## 3. Conventional and Novel Targets for Slowing and/or Preventing the Progress of AD\\n\\nThere are no disease-modifying drugs for AD treatment yet. Existing drugs, e.g., cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil) and NMDA receptor modulators (memantine), only show a palliative effect. There are serious problems in target identification for the development of AD drugs. Both amyloid proteins (A β and tau) possess essential physiological functions in their native state. Therefore, the full blockade of their biosynthesis may cause very severe side effects [118]. The molecular heterogeneity of A β and tau assemblies makes target identification very problematic: which species should be targeted to stop neurodegeneration? If aging is the most dangerous risk factor for AD, how can we slow down the natural aging processes? Finally, the lack of a good animal model for AD causes difficulties in translating the results of animal experiments.\\n\\nVarious biochemical pathways that suppress or remove aggregated proteins are now targeted and examined after a series of failed clinical studies with old AD-drug candidates. Several of these pathways of AD are summarized in Figure 1. The application of multitarget Alzheimer's drugs has very recently been widely reviewed [119]. Intracellular A β is also a therapeutic target [120].\\n\\n## 3.1. Inhibition of the Formation of Toxic Amyloid Aggregates\\n\\n## 3.1.1. Decreasing A β Production\\n\\nThe first approaches to AD drug development were focused on the partial inhibition of the formation A β peptides. Inhibitors of γ - and β -secretases, the key enzymes of amyloidogenic APP processing, have reached phase 2 and phase 3 steps in clinical trials. Although β -Secretase 1 (BACE 1) inhibitors reduced A β production, the drug candidates were not able to slow down cognitive decline [118]. γ -Secretase inhibitors (e.g., avagacestat and semagacestat) caused cognitive loss and other severe side effects.\\n\\nActivation of the nonamyloidogenic pathway of APP procession by activation of α -secretase might be another approach for decreasing A β biosynthesis. Unfortunately, the α -secretase enzyme activators also gave discouraging results in the clinical application [121].\\n\\n## 3.1.2. Blocking A β Aggregation\\n\\nThe mechanism of amyloid protein aggregation has been recently reviewed [122-124]. Targeting A β aggregation is a very frequently used strategy in AD drug development [125]. Many natural or synthetic small molecules, peptides, and peptidomimetics were studied for their modulatory effect on A β aggregation [118]. Polyphenols, tetracyclines, anthracyclines, and sterols have been used as anti-amyloid compounds [125].\\n\\nThe neuroprotective effect of several natural polyphenols (resveratrol, epigallocatechin, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), myricetin, curcumin, and quercetin) has been studied [126]. Myricetin inhibits A β nucleation, while resveratrol, curcumin, quercetin, and EGCG inhibit fibril elongation. Resveratrol and curcumin also decrease the hyperphosphorylation and aggregation of tau protein. Most of the polyphenols (besides inhibiting amyloid aggregation) have an antioxidant effect scavenging free oxygen radicals and protecting DNA from oxidative damage. Resveratrol also modulates neuroinflammation and induces adaptive immunity. Unfortunately, the bioavailability of resveratrol and curcumin is very low. Recently resveratrol was combined with selenium nanoparticles (formation of ResSeNPs). The novel combination has good absorption and might improve resveratrol application in AD treatment [127]. Chitosan-containing selenium nanoparticles (Ch-SeNPs) also inhibited D-amino acid enantiomeric-induced amyloid aggregation [46].\\n\\nMultifunctional metal chelators of the different chemical structures have been designed as potential anti-AD drugs as metal dyshomeostasis contributes to the onset and progression of neurodegeneration [128,129]. Clioquinol, a metal-protein attenuating compound, chelates copper and zinc ions and decreases amyloid aggregation in the brain [130]. PBT2, a clioquinol-related second-generation drug, has been used in clinical studies for the treatment of AD. The Phase 2 study in 42 prodromal AD or mild AD patients gave negative results. However, novel metal chelators might have a better chance. Recent studies with a BBB-permeable silica-cyclen nanochelator gave positive results in a cellular assay [131].\\n\\nNative state stabilization in a highly crowded cellular environment [124] seems to be a novel method of choice for inhibiting the formation of toxic A β aggregates. Peptides designed for mimicking the A β amyloid core (ACM-peptides) coaggregate with A β 1-42 and form nontoxic nanofibers. Proteases easily degrade these fibers, and thus, ACMs might be ideal anti-amyloid drug candidates ([132]. On the contrary, medin, a known protein, promotes the formation of amyloid aggregates and deposits by coaggregation with A β . Researchers hope that medin inhibitors could block the formation of amyloid deposits and may behave as anti-amyloid agents [133]. It has been published very recently that 14-3-3 proteins also bind amyloids, and thus, they can also be targeted as an anti-aggregation approach [134].\\n\\n## 3.1.3. Blocking Tau Biosynthesis\\n\\nEnzyme inhibitors: Tideglusib, a selective inhibitor of the tau-phosphorylating enzyme GSK-3 β , was planned to reduce tau-hyperphosphorylation, leading to pTau aggregation and propagation. Tideglusib and similar compounds were able to reduce the amyloid\\n\\nformation and neuroinflammation. However, the clinical trials have not shown any benefits [118].\\n\\n## 3.1.4. Inhibiting Tau Aggregation and Fibrillation\\n\\nSmall molecules, such as a leukomethylene blue derivative (LMTM), have been used as a tau aggregation inhibitor. The treatment was unsuccessful in a group of 800 patients with mild AD in phase 3 clinical trials [135]. Several compounds have been recently studied for inhibiting tau-fibrillation, till now without success [123].\\n\\n## 3.1.5. Other Tau-Directed Potential Approaches\\n\\nInhibition of the retromer complex, a cargo-sorting protein assembly, increased the toxicity of human tau via increased tau-truncation in an animal model [136]. Retromer deficiency was also connected with tau pathology in Down syndrome patients [137]. There is hope that these results can be translated into AD drug design. Bassoon (BSN), a synaptic scaffold protein, also has an interesting effect: it interacts with tau seeds and contributes to tau propagation and neurotoxicity [138]. In mice, BSN downregulation reduced pathology and propagation by decreasing the stability of tau seeds. The inhibition of BSN-tau interactions might be a novel therapeutic approach for treating AD and other tauopathies.\\n\\n## 3.2. Improvement of Amyloid Clearance. Vascular Dysfunction, BBB, and the Glymphatic System\\n\\nIncreased concentration of soluble A β (sA β ) in the brain is highly correlative with the severity of neurodegeneration [139], as sA β seems to be responsible for the deterioration of synaptic function [140]. Two processes contribute to A β accumulation in the brain: A β production by APP cleavage and transport via the BBB.\\n\\n## 3.2.1. Passive Immunotherapy with Monoclonal Antibodies (mAbs)\\n\\nPassive immunotherapy uses exogenous humanized monoclonal or for the promotion of A β clearance from the brain ([141,142]. Several mAbs (Bapineuzumab, Gantenerumab, Aducanumab, Donanemab, Solanezumab, and Crenezumab) have been developed for targeting amyloid plaques against different epitope regions of A β [143]. Recently, six mAbs have entered phase 3 trials, and Aducanumab (Biogen) was approved by the U.S. FDA for marketing [142]. However, the European Medicine Agency (EMA) refused the approval of Aducanumab, and it is not authorized in Europe. Aducanumab got approval for 4 years for performing a postapproval confirmatory trial (phase 4 trial). As for the neuroprotective action of humanized mAbs, they target amyloid plaques and not monomers. The main therapeutic hypothesis for the application of hmAbs is that reduction in A β and clearance of amyloid plaques would be required for restoring homeostasis in the brain. Aducanumab showed a robust decrease in amyloid burden and full removal of amyloid plaques. Unfortunately, the drug shows a dose-related adverse effect: one-third of the patients showed 'amyloid-related imaging abnormalities' (ARIAs) that can be fatal.\\n\\nLecanemab (Eisai) treatment, designed to neutralize toxic A β protofibrils, has given the best results in clinical studies till now. The phase 3 Clarity trial was performed with 1800 individuals (10 mg/kg mAb infusion every two weeks, 18 months study with early AD patients). This treatment resulted in promising changes in the brain (reduced A β and tau scan). However, cellular death was unaffected, and slowing the progress of dementia was modest (only a 0.45 score on the cognition rating scale) [144]. Bleeding in the brain as a potential risk of the lecanemab treatment was present in 22% of patients. The pharmaceutical enterprise Eisai applied for accelerated approval of the drug to the U.S. FDA, and the decision on January 6th this year was 'full approval'. The success of lecanemab was a big step in AD drug research but initiated a hot debate owing to the modest effect and the risks of application.\\n\\n## 3.2.2. Clearance by the BBB and Activation of the Glymphatic System\\n\\nDysfunction of the neurovascular unit (NVU) may play a decisive role in AD progress [95]. NVU is a complex system of pial arteries, penetrating arterioles, intraparenchymal arteries, and small capillaries. BBB is a specific brain composition of endothelial cells in NVU, together with pericytes, basement membrane, and astroglial end feet. NVUdysfunction is an essential element of AD pathogenesis and a molecular target for ADtherapies by prevention and repair of NVU damage.\\n\\nAge-related declining efficacy of BBB/proteolytic pathways causes a decrease in CSFbased A β clearance in humans [96].\\n\\nIn the late stage of AD patients, the production of A β peptides is relatively constant. However, A β clearance is impaired. Brain capillary endothelial cells mediate A β clearance, leading to A β accumulation in the brain. A β binding transport proteins, e.g., ApoE and clusterin, as well as receptors (e.g., low-density lipoprotein receptor (LRP1), the receptor for advanced glycosylation end product (RAGE), P-glycoprotein transporter (Pgp or ABCB1)) are expressed in BBB and control A β efflux and influx across the BBB.\\n\\nA β deteriorates the components of NVU, and it induces endothelial cell injury by promoting free radical (reactive oxygen species-ROS and reactive nitrogen speciesRNS) formation. Deposition of A β in BBB contributes to the damage of BBB [145]. A β induces the release of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (that leads to chronic neuroinflammation), impairs BBB, and decreases blood flow by up to 40%. Endothelial cell receptors and transporters may serve as potential therapeutic targets for increasing A β clearance [146]. Reduction in RAGE activity and upregulation of LRP1 and Pgp expression will increase A β clearance from the brain [146]. Endothelins (ETs, distinctive peptides of 21 amino acids) are well-known vasoconstrictive agents [147]. Endothelin is a novel target of AD drug research: ET-receptor agonists and antagonists proved to be effective for the prevention of AD in preclinical studies [147].\\n\\nThe glymphatic system (GS) is a unique fluid-transport pathway in the brain as it provides access to all brain regions. It uses the network of tunnels created by astrocytes, the interstitial space between cells such as the lymphatic system. GS pathway plays an important role in cleaning waste from the brain [148]. If the GS does not work properly, toxic waste (e.g., A β and pTau peptides) is not removed from the brain. ApoE plays a decisive role in removing A β assemblies by the glymphatic system. Epigenetic changes (reduced methylation of the APOE gene) are linked to AD progress. Aquaporin 4 (AQP4) water channel is also an important factor for the GS: the loss of polarity of AQP4 reduces GS functions. BBB and the GS interact in solute waste clearance in the late stages of AD [149].\\n\\nGS fluid transport is suppressed in acute and chronic neuroinflammation [150]. Modulation of brain fluid transport may be a novel target for developing new drugs to fight acute and chronic inflammation in the brain. There is evidence that the presence of increased wasteosomes (or corpora amylacea i.e., amyloid bodies) is an indicator of chronic failure of the GS activity [151]. Chronic lymphatic insufficiency is a risk factor for NDDs, and thus, improvement of the GS is a novel target of AD drug strategies.\\n\\n## 3.3. Modulation of Chronic Neuroinflammation\\n\\n## 3.3.1. Chronic Neuroinflammation\\n\\nChronic neuroinflammation (NI) begins in the second phase of AD progress, in the cellular phase [89]. NI is a protective response against different factors causing CNS damage. NI plays an essential role in AD pathogenesis. The innate immune system represents the first line of defense. It was published in 2015 that chronic comorbidities (e.g., arthritis, atherosclerosis, obesity, and metabolic diseases), as well as low-grade systemic inflammation, are risk factors for subsequent dementia [152]. IL-1 β , TNFα , and other proinflammatory mediators may drive hypothalamic dysfunction, impair neurogenesis, and cause cognitive functional decline [93,152]. Cytokine and chemokine signaling play a decisive role in inflammatory diseases, and therefore, they can drive the processes of AD development [153]. Neuroinflammatory markers [154,155] are very important indicators\\n\\nof pathological processes of NDDs [154]. External pathogens activate the brain's innate immune system (e.g., microglia and astrocytes) for the protection of brain cells. However, overactivation of the immune cells results in the release of proinflammatory factors (TNFα , IL-1 β , IL-18, NO, and others). Neuroinflammation begins in the cellular phase of AD and is a potential risk for dementia [156,157]. Soluble oA β can also activate microglia, producing inflammatory cytokines, besides external pathogens [158]. A β activates several microglial receptors, such as CD36, and thereby, it triggers the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and ROS.\\n\\nA β assemblies can trigger the formation of the inflammasome NLRP3, lysosomal disruption, and release of cathepsin-B [158]. Inflammasomes are sensors and regulators of cellular injury and inflammation. Chronic triggering of inflammasomes in the brain tissue leads to an increased level of IL-18 family cytokines [159]. Autophagy dysfunction may be associated with AD pathology, and autophagy activation may suppress neuroinflammation by degrading inflammasomes [160]. The development of small molecular autophagy inducers represents a pharmacological opportunity for the protection of neurons in AD [161].\\n\\nMicroglia (MG) are central players in AD progress [162]. MG has an essential task in the brain which is the perpetual active surveillance of synapses. Since MG are phagocytic cells, they clean the brain tissue from terminally injured neurons, cellular corpses, and debris [163]. MG also has a decisive role in the maturation of the brain by phagocytosis. Deteriorated senescent neurons may cause NI in the AD brain if microglial cleanup does not work properly [164]. Impairment of normal microglial function causes serious effects on normal brain development. MG also regulates myelin growth and integrity in the CNS [165]. MG interacts with neurons and modulates neuronal activity [166]. Absence of MG results in significantly increased brain injury [167]. GWAS studies demonstrated that many of the LOAD risk genes are mainly expressed in MG and not in neurons [168]. 'Different AD risk factors converge on the activation response of microglia' [27-29,169].\\n\\nMGhasamesodermal origin and myeloid nature [170]. Physiological and pathological forms of MG have remarkable morphological diversity. Interleukins activate MG resulting in morphological changes and upregulation of many pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. There are several forms of MG: (1) resting and quiescent, homeostatic MG with ramified morphology, (2) disease-associated, pro-phagocytic MG, and (3) dystrophic or primed, aberrant MG, deramified with shortening and loss of branches [171]. Drug researchers should find a suitable form of MG that could serve as a target for neuroprotection.\\n\\nAstrocytes are the other important immune cells that participate in the neuroinflammatory process and maintain plasticity in the adult brain. Astrocytes serve as targets of future AD drugs [172].\\n\\n## 3.3.2. Neuroinflammation and Glial Cells as Targets for AD Drug Development\\n\\nModulating neuroinflammation and the activity of glial cells are novel targets in AD research (reviewed in [172,173]). Therapeutic strategies include the use of different anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g., indomethacin, VX-745, OTI-125, candesartan, celecoxib, etanercept, and atomoxetin) in different clinical phases. The newest clinical trials are summarized in [172]. Five experiments are in phase 1, nine in phase 2, and one in phase 3 trial. The following potential drug targets have been identified:\\n\\n1. TNF α modulation [174].\\n2. Activation of spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) for increasing the clearance function of MG[175].\\n3. Activation of the CX3CR1 (C-X3-C Motif Chemokine Receptor 1) gene for improved MGphagocytotic activity [176].\\n4. Activation of TREM2 microglial protein for slowing down pTau accumulation and cognitive loss [177].\\n5. Activation of the PLCG (Phospholipase C γ 1) enzyme for promoting the protective function of microglia [178].\\n\\n6. Mitigation of neuroinflammation by increasing the scavenger functions of MG by targeting INPP5 (Inositol Polyphosphate-5-Phosphatase) enzyme [179].\\n7. Modulation of astrocyte activity for A β degradation and clearance, as well as BBB protection [180].\\n8. Creating antioxidant molecules for protecting the brain from the degrading effect of ROS by activation of mucosal-associated invariant T-cells (MAIT-cells) [181].\\n9. Lowering or removing ApoE4 from neurons for decreasing aberrant microglia activation [27-29]\\n\\nThe results of future preclinical and clinical studies will decide which targets prove to be successful in AD drug development.\\n\\n## 4. Conclusions and Outlook\\n\\nAn old dream has been to find a master gene or gene combination whose modulation would slow down the aging process, thereby helping to avoid age-related dementia. This type of master gene has not been found yet. AD drug research has reached a turning point now. The novel targets for biomarker and drug research are not amyloid plaques but intracellular proteins (iA β and oTau) or biochemical pathways. The newest approaches of precise fluid biomarker determinations by cheap clinical mass spectrometry provide a means for the diagnosis of MCI and AD in a large population. It has been widely accepted in recent years that both amyloids (A β and pTau assemblies) participate in the progress of AD. In addition, a drug combination ought to be used for reversing MCI or slowing down the development of AD. Novel protein targets (e.g., medin, BSN, PAR-5) should be used for the prevention of amyloid overproduction and the formation of toxic assemblies. Small molecular inducers of small, neuroprotective Hsps (e.g., crystallines: Hsp B4/5) will be used for inhibiting the formation of toxic amyloid aggregates. Increased A β clearance with the help of monoclonal Abs might be reached by increasing the penetration of big proteins across the BBB and the cell membrane by specific transporters. Special drugs may be developed to augment the effectivity of oA β and oTau clearance by the BBB and the glymphatic system from the aging brain. The dangerous effect of chronic inflammation on neuronal death might be inhibited via novel anti-inflammatory agents (e.g., Sig-1R ligands). Microglia, a double-edged sword in the maintenance of brain homeostasis in a suitable form, might be ideal for phagocytotic clearance of brain waste. Identification of the biochemical markers of activated microglia and the main mediators of neuroinflammation provide novel methods for the selective manipulation of microglia in the future. Novel approaches using rejuvenated immune cells and glial phagocytosis by astrocyte-like Bergman glial cells might also increase A β clearance. Regulation of ApoE4 effect on cholesterol transport and myelination may help AD patients who have a special ApoE4 gene signature. It is expected that physical methods, e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, may also prove to be successful in treating AD.\\n\\nCurrently, there are over 120 different potential new medications for AD in clinical trials. We conclude that over 30 years of intensive experimental work has not provided a genuine breakthrough in AD treatment. A good and suitable animal model of AD for preclinical experiments would be needed. Development of such kind of rodent model mimicking the changes during aging (BBB dysfunction, decreasing A β clearance, A β and tau overproduction, and NI) could be reached by transgenic techniques [182]. The efficacy of A β binding mAbs will be improved during the next years, but their disadvantage is that they only target the extracellular amyloid plaques. The spectrum of drug targets should be widened.\\n\\nThe development of small molecular oral agents for intracellular targets and biological processes (amyloid aggregation, clearance, Hsp, autophagy induction, inflammasomes, etc.) will be the focus of future AD drug research. The development of β - and γ -secretase inhibitors will be abandoned. In the near future, the selection of endangered individuals using genome sequencing and the identification of bad genetic signatures may become feasible. The earliest possible diagnosis (latest in MCI stage) will be necessary for successful\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1. Vaquer-Alicea, J.; Diamond, M.I.

Numerous clinical trials have failed during the past decades. Therefore, scientists need to explore new avenues to tackle this disease. In the present review, we briefly summarize the pathological mechanisms of AD known so far, based on which different therapeutic tools have been designed. Then, we focus on a specific approach that is targeting astrocytes. Indeed, these non-neuronal brain cells respond to any insult, injury, or disease of the brain, including AD. The study of astrocytes is complicated by the fact that they exert a plethora of homeostatic functions, and their disease-induced changes could be context-, time-, and disease specific. However, this complex but fervent area of research has produced a large amount of data targeting different astrocytic functions using pharmacological approaches. Here, we review the most recent literature findings that have been published in the last five years to stimulate new hypotheses and ideas to work on, highlighting the peculiar ability of palmitoylethanolamide to modulate astrocytes according to their morpho-functional state, which ultimately suggests a possible potential disease-modifying therapeutic approach for AD.\\n\\nKeywords: Alzheimer's disease; astrocytes; astrogliosis; beta amyloid; neuroinflammation; neuroprotection; reactive gliosis; palmitoylethanolamide\\n\\n## 1. Introduction\\n\\nAducanumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the aggregated form of the betaamyloid peptide (A β ), was the last unfruitful attempt to treat Alzheimer's disease (AD). At the beginning of November 2020, experts of the Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee of the Food and Drug Administration expressed some concerns about the real efficacy of aducanumab, thus hindering its marketing claiming [1]. The AD field had high expectations for the aducanumab clinical trials, primarily because this human IgG1 monoclonal antibody was designed to selectively bind A β aggregates, including soluble oligomers and insoluble fibrils but not monomers [2], suggesting the possibility to overcome previously failed approaches of other anti-A β antibodies. Unfortunately, the aims were never met, despite they had been well demonstrated at the preclinical level and in the early stages of the clinical trial. This event reveals once again the limitations of both basic and medical research anxiously focused on counteracting A β in AD [3].\\n\\nADis the most common form of dementia in the elderly, affecting about 47 million people worldwide [4]. Most AD cases are sporadic, affecting people older than 65 years old, and aging represents the greatest risk factor [5]. As life expectancy increases, it is reasonable to foresee that the number of AD patients will grow in the next decades. However, other risk factors have been identified besides old age. Growing epidemiological data support the existence of a link between metabolic disorders and AD [6-10], and a correlation between head injury and future risk of dementia has also been suggested.

Family history and heredity are the most important risk factors for the genetic form of this disease, which affects about 1% of individuals with AD, and whose symptoms appear as early as 35 years old [12]. In contrast to heredity and aging, which are nonmodifiable factors, other risk factors could be controlled through general lifestyle improvement and effective management of unhealthy conditions. Indeed, healthy aging, which includes both physical and mental exercise, a balanced diet, staying socially active, and avoiding smoking, preserves both body and brain wellness and reduces the risk for developing dementia [13-15].\\n\\nAt a molecular level, the presence of two peculiar hallmarks characterizes the AD brain: (I) senile plaques, formed by the deposition of A β peptides in the extracellular space, and (II) neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), due to the hyperphosphorylation of microtubuleassociated tau proteins. A growing body of evidence indicates, however, that senile plaques and NFTs alone are not responsible for the cognitive impairments observed in AD [16]. Neuroinflammation and abnormal astrocytic and microglia responses exert a pivotal role in AD pathogenesis and progression, thus highlighting the complexity of this pathology [17-19].\\n\\nADcan be considered as a continuum that spans decades [20], with brain modifications that begin 10-20 years before the clinical manifestations and change throughout the disease progression [21]. Various clinical stages have been classified, such as asymptomatic preclinical, prodromal, mild, moderate, and severe AD [22,23], also referred to as stage 1 to stage 6 [24,25]. Each stage is characterized by peculiar molecular changes that could represent possible targets for different therapeutic approaches [26-28].\\n\\nADis a neurodegenerative disease that impacts memory and cognition. In addition to the progressive impairment in mental abilities, other debilitating noncognitive symptoms usually appear, including sleep disturbances, loss of appetite, and neuropsychiatric conditions, including depression and/or apathy [29,30]. In the latest stages, symptoms worsen enough to interfere with daily activities such that people suffering from AD need continuous care. As a result, the economic burden of AD is impressive, mainly because currently approved drugs are not curative. Despite decades of intense research, no treatments are available to halt, slow, or cure AD, and the therapy still relies on cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine), and the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist memantine. Any of these drugs slightly help to manage behavioral symptoms, preserve mental skills, and slow down the disease progression. However, their effects are reversible and lessen over time due to the continued progression of the disease [31,32].\\n\\nAfinal and confirmed diagnosis of AD can only be made through postmortem identification of histopathological hallmarks. Whenever a patient is suspected to have AD, he/she is already in a mild or moderate stage of the pathology, and substantial irreversible neuronal dysfunction and loss have already occurred. Nowadays, clinicians concur that intervening at the earliest stage of the disease could lead to a better outcome [22,33]. To do so, it will be necessary to identify biological markers allowing diagnosis in the asymptomatic (or, at most, prodromal) stage of the disease to recognize asymptomatic at-risk individuals and refer them to the use of disease-modifying drugs. This approach could be insidious and difficult to achieve since it falls into the field of preventive care. Despite the preclinical stage of AD could represent a temporal window in which it may be possible to reduce the incidence and progression of the disease [34], few preclinical data are available so far at this stage of the pathology [35]. To develop preventive therapeutic approaches for AD in the coming years, the key neurobiological mechanisms of AD need to be clarified.\\n\\nIn this review, we discuss the most recent findings on both old and new mechanisms implicated in AD, with a particular reference to the role played by glial cells. The brain homeostatic functions exerted by glia could represent a novel perspective in AD management, offering new strategies to treat this disease.\\n\\n## 2. Old and New Pathophysiological Mechanisms in AD\\n\\n## 2.1. The Amyloid Cascade Hypothesis\\n\\nThe correlation between A β deposition and dementia has extensively been studied during the past decades, and the amyloidogenic pathway has been widely investigated as a target for drug development [36]. Alois Alzheimer himself described the presence of plaques during the histological examination of his patient's-named Augustinebrain [37,38]. Later after, such plaques were recognized to be protein deposits, mainly A β peptides [39,40]. Several forms of A β peptides have been found in AD brains [41,42]. Longitudinal PET studies demonstrated that proteins begin to deposit about two decades before first symptoms appear [43]; thus, plaque formation is a slow and prolonged process. Plaques accumulate extensively throughout the cortex, with the occipital and temporal lobes being the most affected [44].\\n\\nA β peptides are generated by the cleavage of the type I transmembrane amyloid precursor protein (APP), a protein expressed ubiquitously, which biological functions remain unclear [45,46]. APP is particularly abundant in the brain, and evidence showed that it has trophic properties [47]. It plays a role in brain development by promoting neural stem cells (NSCs) proliferation, cell differentiation, and neuronal maturation [46,48]. APP seems necessary for synaptogenesis, synapse remodeling, and neurite outgrowth [49,50], as well as axonal outgrowth after injury in the adult brain [51]. A neuroregenerative role for brain APPhasbeen hypothesized, even if the molecular mechanisms have not been elucidated yet. The production of APP increases in some physiological conditions, such as during neuronal maturation and differentiation, and in some pathological ones, including AD, brain trauma, and Down syndrome [52]. To complicate the picture, alternative transcriptional splicing could create 8 to 11 different APP isoforms [53].\\n\\nThe enzymatic processing of APP yields various peptides with distinct functions through three different proteolytic pathways, among which only one seems to be amyloidogenic. This process releases mainly two monomers of A β : about 90% is A β 40, which is considered nontoxic because it does not self-aggregate much, and the remaining part is mainly constituted of longer A β peptides [54]. Being more hydrophobic and prone to aggregate than the shorter isoforms, the A β 42 and A β 43 could form oligomers and fibrils; thus, they are considered neurotoxic isoforms [36,55]. In addition to A β 42 and A β 43, some reports consider also the amyloid precursor protein intracellular domain to be involved in the pathophysiology of AD [52,56,57].\\n\\nThe nonamyloidogenic pathway is thought not to generate toxic A β and a third proteolytic pathway has been recently described, involving a η -secretase that cuts the APP extracellular domain releasing a soluble ectodomain. The biological functions of all peptides yielded through this newly described pathway are yet to be disclosed.\\n\\nAlthough most of the research studies investigated the neurotoxicity of A β peptides, they also exert biological functions. They are not abundantly expressed, even in AD brains [58], and they execute trophic actions, including cell fate specification and proliferation. Exogenous application of soluble and fibrillary A β peptides (but not oligomeric forms) stimulates human embryonic stem cells (ESCs) proliferation [59]. Oligomeric A β peptides reduce the proliferative potential of human NSC, promoting their differentiation toward glial instead of neuronal cells [60]. The A β 40 seems to preferably enhance neurogenesis, whereas the A β 42 seems to promote gliogenesis [61,62]. Some authors have also observed neurogenesis induced by oligomers of A β 42, and not A β 40, in rat hippocampal NSCs [63]. Further studies are warranted since these contradictory results are probably due to the different forms of A β used.\\n\\nThe amyloid cascade hypothesis states that the progressive accumulation and oligomerization of A β 42 creates diffuse plaques in the brain parenchyma, causing neuroinflammation and, later, neurofibrillary tangles, ultimately leading to synaptic dysfunction or loss, and neuronal death [36,64]. This hypothesis has been formulated after having identified the APP gene on chromosome 21, together with the observation that people affected by Down syndrome develop AD-like symptoms early in life. Several pathogenic coding mutations\\n\\nin the APP gene have been identified and linked to the onset of autosomal dominant AD[64-66]. This hypothesis is supported by the correlation between autosomal dominant mutations in both APP and genes coding for parts of the secretase, such as presenilin (PSEN) 1, PSEN2, with the incidence of AD [36,64,67].\\n\\nHowever, reduced clearance of A β peptides could also account for their accumulation in the brain. A protein involved both in the clearance of A β and in its ability to aggregate and form fibrils is the apolipoprotein E (apoE) [68,69]. Homozygous carriers for the isoform ε 4 have about a 12-fold higher risk to develop sporadic AD, while carriers of the less frequent ε 2 isoform show a low risk for AD [70,71]. Despite all the findings that strongly support the amyloid cascade hypothesis, other data suggest instead that the accumulation of senile plaques in the brain does not correlate with cognitive impairment. Indeed, massive cerebral accumulation of A β plaques has also been observed in individuals without any cognitive impairment. Additionally, the reduction of A β load by immunotherapy does not improve cognition in AD patients [72]. Furthermore, all clinical trials carried out so far targeting either the production or the accumulation of A β have failed. The debate is fervent in the literature and undoubtfully more studies are needed to clarify the precise mechanism(s) by which A β deposits lead to tangle formation, and thus neurodegeneration [3].\\n\\n## 2.2. Neurofibrillary Tangles\\n\\nNeurofibrillary tangles are considered essential for the neuropathological diagnosis of AD [26]. They are intraneuronal bundles of filaments made of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated tau proteins [73]. Their accumulation causes a loss of cytoskeletal microtubules and tubulin-associated proteins, resulting in morphological modifications in neuronal dendrites and axons [74].\\n\\nSince NFTs appearance in the brain seems to follow a pattern, in a seminal paper, Braak and Braak proposed to classify AD in six stages based on neuropathological findings [44,75].\\n\\nAt physiological conditions, the protein tau is mainly localized in the axon, and it is essential for the stabilization of microtubules [76]. Its phosphorylation is highly probable because tau has 85 potential sites of phosphorylation that are easily accessible because of the unfolded structure of the protein [77]. Tau has been found mislocalized (missorted) into the somatodendritic compartment at the early stages of AD. Since NFTs load correlates with cognitive decline and synapse loss [74], a role for tau missorting has been proposed in AD[78], which serves as diagnostic criteria and for the staging of disease progression [79]. Interestingly, abnormal phosphorylation of tau is detectable even before NFTs formation. In agreement, the reduction of tau has beneficial effects in preclinical AD models, whereas tau mislocalization from axons to dendrites has detrimental effects [80,81]. In general, the major modifications of tau found in AD are hyperphosphorylation, missorting, aggregation to oligomers and filaments forming paired helical filaments, dissociation from microtubules, and other post-translational modifications [78].\\n\\nMutations in genes encoding for tau have not been linked to AD. However, tau knockout mice show very mild neurite outgrowth changes and no microtubule-related defects [82,83]. Human findings showed that microtubule density is decreased in AD patients, but this reduction is surprisingly unrelated to tau abnormalities [84]. Consistent with the above, a simple loss of function of tau is not enough to explain the loss of microtubules observed in AD, and other mechanisms are probably involved.\\n\\nSeveral tau-targeting therapies for AD have been proposed. These approaches are based mainly on (i) inhibition of kinases (responsible for aberrant tau phosphorylation), (ii) inhibition of tau aggregation, and (iii) stabilization of microtubules. Immunotherapies targeting tau in clinical trials have shown high toxicity and/or lack of efficacy and have been discontinued [85].\\n\\n## 2.3. Unfolded Protein Response and Defective Proteostasis\\n\\nADis a neurological disease characterized by the ubiquitous association of misfolded and aggregated proteins, whose role in the pathogenesis and progression of the disease is still unclear. However, it is reasonable to hypothesize that a significant dysfunction in protein homeostasis (proteostasis) occurs. Proteostasis is complex since it requires proteins to be in a specific localization, aggregation, concentration, and conformation. Multiple events occurring in AD have been suggested to act as proteostasis perturbators, including NFTs [86], neuroinflammation [87], altered calcium signaling [88], mitochondrial energy imbalance [89], and oxidative stress [90]. Most of these have been linked to endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [91]. The ER is an essential organelle in eukaryotes responsible for the synthesis and folding of all secretory and membrane proteins [92]. Under physiological conditions, when aberrant proteins are synthesized, the ER exports them to the cytosol, where they are directed to the ubiquitin-proteasome system for degradation [93]. In AD, the massive accumulation of aberrant misfolded proteins at the ER engages the unfolded protein response (UPR), a complex signaling system stress response that orchestrates protein folding and initiates apoptosis, or autophagy, in irreversibly damaged cells [94]. Growing evidence indicates that ER stress responses may also affect metabolic pathways that generate A β , suggesting its direct role in AD etiology. For instance, it has been demonstrated that UPR signaling events increase BACE1 levels, causing A β overproduction and promoting the transcription of the PSEN gene [95].\\n\\n## 2.4. Complement Cascade and Neuroinflammation\\n\\nInflammation has been recognized as a key component of AD pathology [96], likely contributing even to the progression of the disease [97,98]. Several transcription factors involved in the inflammatory responses have been found involved in AD. For example, the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (c/EBP) family of transcription factors is elevated in brains from AD patients, compared to healthy controls [99], and it was found to promote microglial neuroinflammatory response [100]. Another example is the NF-kB pathway that controls cytokine production and cell survival, which is strongly associated with AD neuroinflammation [101].\\n\\nBoth the classical and alternative complement pathways are induced in vitro by fibrillar A β [102] and NFTs [103]. Senile plaques colocalize with microglia and many proteins of the complement cascade in animal models of the disease and human AD [62,104-106]. Moreover, human AD brains show signs of activation of the complement in the same areas presenting senile plaques and NFTs [107]. Complement factors have been shown to be elevated during AD progression, likely as a general reaction to abnormal protein deposition and other cerebral injuries that occur in the AD brain [108-110]. This is not surprising, since the complement cascade is a fundamental effector of the innate immune system that favors the rapid clearance of pathogens, apoptotic cells, and their debris, as well as the extent and termination of the inflammatory immune response [111]. Some components of the complement cascade play a key role in synapse pruning. This process is active and fundamental during the development of the nervous system. However, it is scarcely seen in the adult brain when its occurrence is thought to be detrimental, as in AD brains. Indeed, evidence of excessive complement-mediated synapse pruning has been reported in AD and animal models of aging [112-114]. Regardless, some human evidence shows inconsistency between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentration of complement proteins [110], highlighting the heterogenicity of the pathology, which complicates the path to use complement proteins as diagnostic biomarkers. However, components of the complement could be also potential novel therapeutic targets [111,115]. In preclinical models of neurodegenerative disorders, the inhibition of specific complement proteins had beneficial effects [116,117]. Unfortunately, the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is not accessible to current complement-targeted therapeutics, making drug design challenging [117]. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms underlying the inflammatory process observed in AD have not\\n\\nbeen fully clarified yet. This could explain the failure of the clinical trials conducted so far using conventional anti-inflammatory drugs [118-122].\\n\\nNeuroinflammation is a complex defensive process crucial for the preservation of brain homeostasis that becomes detrimental under certain circumstances, which is not fully understood. It is now accepted that any cerebral insult triggers the activation of glial cells in a defensive, preservative process aimed at restoring the lost homeostasis. Both morphological and functional modifications of mainly, but not exclusively, microglia and astrocytes occur accompanied by a pro-inflammatory environment [19]. Microglia cells, being the immune sentinels of the central nervous system (CNS), are the first cells responding with a potent inflammatory response, consequently leading to the activation of other glial cell types, including astrocytes [123,124]. If the stimuli that activate glial cells are very intense, and/or long lasting, and/or not counterbalanced by an interruption signal, reactive gliosis could be established and the normal brain functioning could be altered, leading even to neuronal death [125]. However, the exact timing and mechanisms that turn neuroinflammation from a physiological to a pathological process are still under study [126,127]. Therefore, the clarification of the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms could allow scientists to develop and test new, and hopefully efficacious, pharmacological treatments. For example, a recent study identified a negative regulator of the transcription factor c/EBPb, responsible for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation, which could represent a novel AD therapeutic target [100]. Of note, c/EBPb is expressed also by astrocytes. Thus, additional studies should address the possibilities of targeting it in different cell types involved in the neuroinflammatory process.\\n\\n## 2.5. The Neuroenergetic Hypothesis\\n\\nGlucose is the main brain energy fuel, which crosses the BBB through GLUT1, a membrane-bound glucose transporter. Both aging and AD are associated with a reduction of GLUT1 [128,129]. Additionally, transgenic mouse models show a correlation between the decreased density of GLUT1 and A β peptide accumulation [129,130]. In aged humans, an association between glucose hypometabolism and apoE genotype has been made [131]. The main signaling that mediates the uptake of glucose inside cells is the interaction of the pancreatic hormone insulin with its receptor. AD demented patients show a high level of plasma insulin, while low levels of both CSF insulin and brain insulin receptors. In accordance, insulin resistance has been correlated with dementia, and patients with type-2 diabetes have a much higher risk to develop AD [132]. Indeed, glucose acts as a memory enhancer since the neuronal activity is tightly coupled to glucose utilization [133]. Using 5xFAD mice as an AD model, Andersen et al. showed that neuronal GABA synthesis in the brain is directly affected by glucose hypometabolism in astrocytes [134]. Under normal conditions, astrocytes produce ATP and lactate that are released to feed neighboring neurons, in a process known as the astrocyte-neuron lactate shuttle, that energetically supports neurons given their high-energy requirements, such as action potential firing [135-137]. This shuttle is necessary for long-term potentiation [135]. Berchtold et al. reported that many genes involved in mitochondrial bioenergetics were upregulated in aged individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), relative to age-matched controls, but downregulated in full-blown AD patients [138]. All this evidence contributed to the so-called neuroenergetic hypothesis, which posits that the chronic progressing starving of brain cells could produce energy-deficiency stress. This reduces neuronal firing and induces a shift from pathways associated with physiological APP metabolism to pathological ones, related to A β /tau production [139], ultimately leading to AD.\\n\\n## 3. Astrocytes as Targets for AD Therapeutics\\n\\nIn the beginning, the interest in glial cells in AD arose mainly from the role played by the microglia cells in the immune response [140]. Afterward, it became clear that all types of glial cells were probably involved in both the etiology and progression of the disease, as actors in the context of the immune response and key regulating elements involved\\n\\nin the molecular and cellular processes altered in AD [141]. Indeed, cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in human AD brains have been associated with distinct molecular pathways [142].\\n\\nGlial cells are a heterogeneous cell population exerting a plethora of different actions necessary for the correct functioning of the brain [143]. Glial cells are usually classified into microglia and macroglia. The latter have a neural origin and include astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and NG-2 glia, also known as synantocytes [144].\\n\\nMicroglia are the main immunocompetent cells of the nervous system with a nonneural origin. Being macrophages, they fulfill primarily defensive functions [145]. These cells regularly scan the surrounding environment with their processes and adapt their morphology and functions depending on what they sense. Upon activation, microglia exert chemotactic and phagocytic properties, moving where needed and clearing waste products, cellular debris, and pathogens [146]. In addition to these crucial defensive functions, microglia exert many other key actions related to synapse formation, pruning, and functioning [147-149]. Microglia cells show various activation states and expression profiles in both human AD brains and murine AD models [150]. The pathway analysis of single-nucleus transcriptomic experiments revealed that microglial genes mostly related to the immune response were differentially expressed between human AD brains and control subjects [142]. Additionally, the mutation in TREM2, a cell surface protein selectively and highly expressed by microglia in the brain, has been associated with a three-fold higher risk to develop AD [151].\\n\\nOligodendrocytes originate from precursor cells (OPCs) mainly localized in the ventricular zones of the brain, from which they migrate during development, through which they become mature oligodendrocytes. This process starts during the third trimester of gestation and continues throughout life [152]. Oligodendrocyte's main function is the creation of the myelin sheath, crucial for effective neuronal transmission of action potentials [153]. Under the myelin sheath, in the internodal periaxonal space, oligodendrocytes establish direct connections with axons via cytoplasmic-rich myelinic channels, in which a bidirectional movement of macromolecules occurs between the two cells [152,154,155]. Impairments in myelin formation and functions have implications in several neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders [156-160], and the maturation of OPCs into oligodendrocytes is accelerated by the loss of myelin due to injuries, aging, or diseases, including AD [157].\\n\\nAstrocytes maintain CNS homeostasis at molecular, cellular, organ, and system levels of organization [161]. Several morphologically distinct subtypes of astrocytes have been identified that likely correspond to specific functions [162]. Indeed, they are present both in the white and grey matter. Astrocytes are key components of the BBB, thus regulating the communication between the CNS and the periphery [163]. They control the CNS microenvironment in several ways, including by buffering extracellular ions and the pH, regulating blood flow through the release of vasoactive molecules, and clearing reactive oxygen species (ROS) [164]. Astrocytes are components of the so-called gliocrine system, releasing around 200 molecules, mainly neurotrophic factors, and energy substrates, fundamental for the maintenance of CNS homeostatic functions [165]. Astrocytes exert primary roles in synaptic transmission and information processing by neural circuits. It has been demonstrated the ability of a single astrocyte to be in contact with several neurons and to modulate synaptic transmission by tuning neurotransmitter levels in the synaptic cleft [162,163].\\n\\nOriginally classified as OPCs, synantocytes are stellate cells, with large process arborizations that specifically express a new type of chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan [166]. They are found both in white and grey matter and interact with other glial cell types and neurons. Synantocytes extend processes along myelin sheaths to contact also the paranodes and nodes of Ranvier. Moreover, they were found to take part in the synaptic cradle, but their specific function at synapses has not been clarified yet [167,168].\\n\\nGiven the essential and pleiotropic functions driven by glial cells, the interest in the involvement of these cells in the pathophysiology of several neurological and neuropsy-\\n\\nchiatric disorders has grown exponentially in the last years [169]. Additionally, different glial cell types can communicate and influence each other's phenotype and functions. However, the mechanisms and implications of those cross-talks are only beginning to be elucidated [124,170,171]. Below we focus on the evidence supporting a role for impaired astrocyte functioning in AD, and the potential therapeutic benefit that approaches aimed at restoring them could have.\\n\\nThe role of astrocytes in AD is difficult to decipher, mainly for two reasons: firstly, astrocytes exert a huge plethora of different functions in the CNS that are not easy to tease apart, and secondly, astrocytes respond to any perturbation of CNS homeostasis, caused by either injuries or diseases, with a variety of changes at structural, transcriptional, and functional levels. Additionally, the alterations are specific to the astrocyte localization and the CNS insult, and even to the different stages of the disease [125,172-174]. Regarding AD, the evidence available so far suggests the presence of both glial reactivity and atrophy since the initial stages of AD [97]. Additionally, astrocytes close to amyloid plaques show greater transcriptional changes than those far from plaques [175]. To complicate the picture, recent human studies showed that postmortem AD brains contain a reduced proportion of neuroprotective astrocytes, which are associated with glutamate recycling and synaptic signaling, compared to controls [142]. Moreover, the notion that astrocytes are asthenic in the final stages of AD is gaining ground. Regardless, both reactive and asthenic astrocytes operate in an erratic manner, thus contributing differently to the worsening of the disease through neuronal impairment and death [176]. Therefore, the difficulty to develop a pharmacological approach targeting astrocytes increases, since a drug directed to hypertrophic astrocytes in a specific AD stage could be detrimental in another stage at which astrocytes are atrophic, and vice versa. Moreover, modulating astrocytes could affect the functioning of other glial cell types, besides neurons [177,178], altering the normal communication among brain cells. Another important challenge to overcome when designing a therapy directed to the brain is the necessity for it to cross the BBB. It has been reported that only 5% of about 7000 drugs screened in the Comprehensive Medical Chemistry database are actually able to enter the CNS passing the BBB [179,180].\\n\\nThere is a growing number of reports looking at the role of astrocytes in AD, and several approaches targeting astrocytes have been proposed (Figure 1). The following sections review both in vitro and in vivo evidence that has been published in the last five years targeting astrocytes pharmacologically in models of AD (Table 1).\\n\\nBiomolecules\\n\\n2021\\n\\n,\\n\\n11\\n\\n, x\\n\\n9 of 32\\n\\nFigure 1.

Targeting Astrocyte Senescence\\n\\nAging is considered one of the main risk factors for the development of neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [220]. Studies on cellular aging are attracting much attention as a fervent area of research [221,222], and recent evidence demonstrates that astrocytes senescence has a critical role in the pathogenesis of AD. As time goes by, astrocytes show peculiar cellular and molecular changes assuming the so-called senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [223]. This is accompanied by upregulation and release of proinflammatory cytokines, including interleukin(IL)-1 β and IL-6, chemokines, and proteinases [175,184,224]. Overexpression of intermediate filament proteins glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and vimentin occurs, whereas neurotrophic growth factors result downregulated. The chromatin undergoes several modifications, and there is upregulation of p53, p21 WAF1 , and p16 INK4A , leading to a permanent cell cycle arrest [225,226]. These features may not be specific senescence markers for astrocytes since they are postmitotic cells that do not usually divide in healthy tissues [126]. Regardless, one of the most common features of aging is the accumulation of senescent cells. Bussian et al. demonstrated that the presence of senescent astrocytes and microglia in a mouse model of aggressive tauopathy (the PS19 mice) promotes the formation of hyperphosphorylated tau aggregates. Removing p16 INK4A -expressing senescent cells through a genetic approach prevented astrogliosis, hyperphosphorylation of tau, degeneration of cortical and hippocampal neurons, and it preserved transgenic mouse cognitive functions [182]. Comparable effects have been obtained by testing a senolytic agent, the orally active anticancer drug ABT263 (navitoclax), that acts as inhibiting Bcl-2. By this mechanism, this compound is able to induce apoptosis specifically in senescent cells [227]. The clearance of accumulated senescent astrocytes also rescued in vivo the radiation-induced impaired astrocytic neurovascular coupling and mice cognitive performance [181]. Another report showed that the overexpression of an inhibitory isoform of p53, the D 133p53, which is downregulated in AD, repressed the SASP after its induction in astrocytes by exposure to radiation. D 133p53 overexpression promoted also DNA repair and inhibited irradiated astrocyte-mediated neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity [183]. The antiprotozoal drug pentamidine upregulates p53 and increases the ratio BAX/Bcl2, ultimately promoting apoptosis in cultured astroglioma cells [228], and it exerts anti-inflammatory effects in mice receiving human A β 42 into the hippocampus [229]. Finally, from the field of phytotherapy, an in vitro study showed that Ginsenoside F1 suppresses the SASP in astrocytes by downregulating the p38MAPK-dependent NFκ B activity [184], a pathway upregulated in AD.\\n\\n## 3.2. Targeting Astrocyte Glutamate Transporters\\n\\nGlutamate represents the major excitatory neurotransmitter of the CNS, whose neurotransmission is finely regulated by both neurons and glial cells [230]. Astrocytes, in particular, are responsible for glutamate reuptake from the synaptic cleft through excitatory\\n\\namino acid transporters (EAATs). There are five subtypes of EAATs (EAAT1-EAAT5), but EAAT2 (glutamate transporter-1/GLT1) is responsible for more than 90% of glutamate reuptake [231]. Once inside the astrocyte, glutamate is converted mainly into glutamine by the glutamine synthetase (GS) and then shuttled back to the presynaptic neuron, which uses it to synthesize glutamate again. A portion of glutamate is converted to gammaaminobutyric acid (GABA), which is usually catabolized. The glutamate-glutamine shuttle is crucial for glutamate homeostasis, and thereby for learning and memory. If the shuttle is dysfunctional, an abnormal glutamate stimulation could occur, which is neurotoxic [232]. Glutamate excitotoxicity has been observed in AD and correlated with cognitive decline [232,233]. In parallel, both accumulation of GABA, whose concentration is low in astrocytes under physiological circumstances [234], and its release from reactive astrocytes have been observed in transgenic animal models of AD (5xFAD and APP/PS1 mice), resulting in memory deficits [235,236]. However, astrocytic GABA content seems to follow a bell-shaped curve along aging and not relate to A β [237]. Human postmortem AD brains showed altered expression of several GABA transporters in cortical and hippocampal regions [238]. Therefore, counteracting dysfunctions in the content of neurotransmitters and the expression of their transporters could likely be beneficial in AD. Research targeting the modulation of astrocytic GABA is still not fully explored, and further studies are warranted. Instead, the enhancement of glutamate transporter function and expression has been tested using various activators in several neurological diseases [239]; however, few studies were carried out in AD models. β -lactam antibiotics are drugs that upregulate GLT1 gene transcription, in addition to having antibacterial effects [240,241]. Among them, ceftriaxone was found to ameliorate AD pathology by improving spatial learning and memory in APP/PS1 mice, upregulating the expression of both GS and the system N glutamine transporter 1 (SN1) [185]. Another drug already approved for human use is riluzole, which has been shown to improve memory performance in aged rats and in 5xFAD mice [186,242]. Riluzole is a neuroprotective agent able to increase Na + -dependent glutamate uptake in synaptosomes in a dose-dependent manner [243]. Riluzole chronic oral administration prevents age-related gene expression changes in rats' hippocampi [244] and reduces the levels of A β 42 and A β 40 oligomers and neuritic plaques in 5xFAD mice [186]. Despite being so promising, these results have not been translated into the clinic yet.\\n\\n## 3.3. Targeting the Astrocytic Metabolic System\\n\\nAs we mentioned before, failure of astrocytes in supporting neuronal energy needs could facilitate the progression from physiological to pathological brain aging. For instance, the metabolic products of fatty acid oxidation decrease during AD [245], making lipid metabolism a potential target for AD treatment. Recently, an in vitro study found that activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) beta/delta (PPAR β / δ ) increases fatty acid oxidation [187]. Indeed, a rate-limiting enzyme of the fatty acid oxidation is the carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1A (CPT1A), which catalyzes the transfer of fatty acids into the mitochondria, where the β -oxidation occurs. Konttinen et al. tested the effects of GW0742, a synthetic PPAR β / δ agonist, in human astrocytes obtained from pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) of AD patients carrying an amyloidogenic mutation of PSEN1 (PSEN1 D E9). GW0742 enhanced the expression of CPT1a, increasing astrocyte fatty acid oxidation [187]. In primary astrocytes obtained by 5xFAD mice, which show an altered metabolic profile, administration of the vitamin B5 precursor pantethine reversed several metabolic alterations induced by A β challenge, including (i) altered activity of the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, the α -ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex, and the succinate dehydrogenase; (ii) decreased ATP production; and (iii) altered expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha, known to protect against A β toxicity. Pantethine treatment showed some anti-inflammatory actions by downregulating IL-1 β expression [188]. Similarly, treatment of the astroglioma cell line C6 with hydroxytyrosol, the major polyphenol contained in olives, ameliorated the metabolism of glucose, previously altered by A β (25-35) challenge, through activation of Akt [189].\\n\\nEvidence demonstrates the ability of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) to improve cognitive deficits in AD [246]. Zheng et al. just published that this effect is related to GLP-1 ability to restore in vitro the A β -induced glycolysis impairment in astrocytes, by activating the PI3K/Akt pathway [190]. A recent study by Wang et al. demonstrated that metformin, a hypoglycemic drug of clinical use, exerts anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects in rat primary astrocytes treated with high glucose concentration [191], strengthening the link between altered metabolism and induction of inflammatory process.\\n\\n## 3.4. Upregulation of Astrocytic Neurotrophins and Growth Factors\\n\\nNeurotrophic factors imbalance and dysregulation are associated with neurodegenerative diseases, including AD [247]. The brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is involved in cognition and memory formation, given its role in modulating synaptic plasticity. Astrocytes can release neurotrophic growth factors, including BDNF, exerting protective effects on neurons [248]. Thus, the increase in astrocyte neurotrophic factor expression and release could be a therapeutic approach for AD [249]. Sawamoto et al. found that the citrus flavonoid 3,5,6,7,8,30,40-heptamethoxyflavone (HMF) exerts neuroprotective effects by increasing the expression of BDNF in astrocytes within the hippocampus of mice and in the C6 glioma cell line. The BDNF increase was induced by the activation of cAMP/ERK/CREB signaling and inhibition of phosphodiesterase 4B and 4D [192]. Another molecule found to be able to upregulate BDNF expression in cultured astrocytes is quetiapine, a widely used atypical antipsychotic drug [193]. Recently, a paper in which transgene delivery in astrocytes was used to obtain the upregulation of BDNF in 5xFAD mice was published [194]. Specifically, 5xFAD mice were crossed with transgenic pGFAPBDNF mice, expressing BDNF under the GFAP promoter. The resulting transgenic mice showed restored levels of BDNF, compared to 5xFAD mice, which have reduced levels of this neurotrophin compared to their wild-type counterparts. BDNF restoration also resulted in improvements in cognitive tasks and ameliorated synaptic plasticity [194].\\n\\nSome studies have also explored the potential beneficial effects of neural stem cell transplantation in models of AD. An Indian group studied the lineage negative stem cells (Lin-ve) derived from human umbilical cord blood (hUCB) in an animal model of A β 42-induced injury. They found that intrahippocampal transplant of these cells at specific dosage and timing shows potential to reverse hippocampal A β 42-induced mouse cognitive impairment, measured by Morris water maze and passive avoidance, through a neuroprotective mechanism likely mediated by BDNF upregulation [195,250]. Blockade of the BDNF-TrkB pathway by systemic administration of a TrkB inhibitor nullified the benefit of Lin-ve cell transplant. A β 42-challenged mice showed decreased BDNF and GFAP protein and gene expression, which were both reversed by Lin-ve cell transplant. Some less clear effects were detected also in the expression levels of both the glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), which deserve further studies [195].\\n\\nAD pathogenesis is also affected by altered production of growth factors [251,252], including the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 2 [247]. In particular, FGF2 is increased in reactive astrocytes around senile plaques [253]. Last year, Chen et al. demonstrated that FGF2 has protective effects against A β 42-induced cytotoxicity in primary cultured cortical astrocytes. In their experiments, primary astrocytes challenged with A β 42 were treated with either high or low molecular weight forms of FGF2. The low molecular isoform of FGF2 promoted astrocyte proliferation, enhancing the expression of c-Myc, Cyclin D1, Cyclin E [196].\\n\\n## 3.5. Targeting Astrocytes-Driven Amyloid Aggregation and Clearance\\n\\nAccumulation of A β could be the result of its increased synthesis or reduced clearance or a combination of both. Looking for AD treatment, an important area of investigation targets A β clearance, which depends, at least in part, on astrocytes. Indeed, astrocytes can take up A β and digest it in their lysosomes. However, the astrocytic degrading machine\\n\\ncould get engulfed, leading to detrimental consequences [254]. Lysosome functions and gene expression for proteins involved in both autophagy and proteolysis were found altered in aging and AD [255,256]. Two of the apolipoproteins associated with high risk for developing sporadic AD are secreted by astrocytes and are involved in A β aggregation and clearance, the apoE4 and the apoJ (also known as clusterin) [69,257]. The apoE4, once secreted by astrocytes, binds to high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-like particles, and the level of its lipidation influences A β aggregation and clearance [258]. Chernick et al. demonstrated the ability of an HDL mimetic peptide, the 4F, to increase apoE4 lipidation in primary human and murine astrocytes. That counteracts the A β -induced accumulation of intracellular apoE4, mitigating A β detrimental effects on proper cellular trafficking and functionality of apoE [197]. Clusterin (Clu) is a ubiquitous protein whose functions are still not clear, but studies have shown its involvement in A β aggregation, toxicity, and clearance. Conflicting results have been published reporting both neuroprotective and detrimental properties of Clu [259,260]. Novel in vitro findings demonstrated a role for astrocytic Clu in promoting synapse formation and glutamatergic synaptic activity [199]. Wojtas et al. overexpressed Clu (&gt;about 30%) selectively in GFAP-positive astrocytes of APP/PS1mice and noticed a reduction in A β accumulation and formation of fibrillary deposits in both cortex and hippocampus compared to control animals. In the same brain areas, the authors found that Clu overexpression was associated with a reduction of the number of cortical and hippocampal dystrophic neurites [198]. In accordance, the reduction (&lt;about 50%) in Clu expression in GFAP-positive astrocytes of APP/PS1 mice leads to a worsening of the AD-like outcomes [198]. Novel in vivo findings demonstrated that Clu overexpression in astrocytes enhances excitatory neurotransmission and rescues the synaptic deficit in Clu knockout mice. Clu overexpression in GFAP-positive astrocytes of 5xFAD mice reduced plaque numbers and plaque size and rescued presynaptic dysfunction [199].\\n\\nAnother molecule that seems to promote A β clearance is the epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), a member of the catechin family. In cultured astrocytes, ECGC elevates neprilysin (NEP) expression, one of the most important A β -degrading enzymes in the brain, involving also the activation of ERK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase [200].\\n\\nMoreover, oral administration of fish oil, containing n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), was found effective in clearing A β from the brain of fat-1 transgenic mice [201], but not of aquaporin (AQP) 4 knockout mice, suggesting the involvement of AQP4 protein, expressed selectively in astrocytes, in A β clearance. Additionally, PUFAs administration protected from AQP4 polarization occurring after A β injection [201], a sign of astrocytic dysfunction [261].\\n\\n## 3.6. Targeting Astrocytic Reactivity, Complement Cascade, Neuroinflammation, and Oxidative Stress\\n\\nNeuroinflammation plays a pivotal role in the development and progression of AD. Indeed, A β plaques are surrounded by activated glial cells, and A β itself leads to the activation of astrocytes and microglia, together with the release of proinflammatory factors [97,262-264]. Brains of different transgenic mouse models of AD show activated astrocytes, even before the appearance of plaques and NFTs [265,266]. When astrogliosis occurs, reactive astrocytes produce inflammatory markers, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α , IL-1 β , and IL-6, and calcineurin, a protein phosphatase that mediates inflammatory responses. This is associated with a wide number of cellular events, including the aforementioned activation of the complement cascade, the release of nitric oxide, and ROS. This phenomenon is normally engaged with the intent of defending the brain by removing injurious stimuli (e.g., A β fibrils phagocytosis). However, if prolonged beyond physiological limits, it would have detrimental effects. Therefore, targeting astrocyte reactivity and, consequently, the related activation of the complement cascade, the oxidative stress and the inflammatory response could represent an effective therapeutic strategy in AD. A compound that has shown such properties is cannabidiol, the main nonpsychoactive component of Cannabis Sativa [267]. Studies demonstrated cannabidiol effects in reduc-\\n\\ning both GFAP and S100B mRNA and protein expression, as well as neuroinflammatory parameters in different models of AD [268-270].\\n\\nThe complement component C3 is increased in human AD brains, and it is expressed by reactive astrocytes. Its increased expression is required for neurodegeneration to occur [271]; thus, its targeting could be beneficial. Indeed, Shi et al. compared aged plaquerich transgenic APP/PS1 mice knockout (KO) for the C3 to transgenic APP/PS1 mice to evaluate A β plaque pathology, glial responses to plaques, and neuronal dysfunction in the brains. They found that C3 KO mice had less activation of glial cells at the center of A β plaques compared to control mice, suggesting that the downregulation of C3 controls astrocyte activation and neuroinflammation in AD [202].\\n\\nMc Manus et al. tested the effect of infection by Bordetella Pertussis in APP/PS1 mice and the potential benefit of fingolimod (FTY720) administration, an FDA-approved immunomodulatory drug for treating multiple sclerosis. Fingolimod reduced signs of infection-induced BBB increased permeability, GFAP immunoreactivity, and A β deposits, compared to control mice. Results of additional in vitro experiments in primary astrocytes suggested that the decreased A β accumulation was driven by the fingolimod-induced increase in the phagocytic capacity of astrocytes [203].\\n\\nSince A β activates the astrocytic inflammasome promoting the release of IL-1 β , Couturier et al. demonstrated that the downregulation of this A β -induced inflammatory process increases A β phagocytosis in astrocytes in vitro. That is due to the release of the chemokine CCL3, ultimately improving in vivo the memory deficits of 5xFAD mice [204]. Therefore, that phlogistic event represents a druggable therapeutic target, which still needs to be thoroughly investigated. Several molecules have been tested during the last years for their ability to dampen astrocyte reactivity in AD [269,270,272,273], but none have been translated to the clinic yet. Patients with MCI and vascular dementia show increased levels of Lipocalin 2 (Lcn2) in the CSF. In AD cases (stages V and VI), Lcn2 immunoreactivity increased in reactive astrocytes localized around plaques and in reactive microglia [274]. Astrocytes are the major producers of Lcn2 in the brain [275]. This protein is involved in several processes including inflammation, iron metabolism, cell death, and cell survival, modulating the cellular response to A β [275]. Staurenghi et al. demonstrated that increased levels of oxysterols observed in mild or severe AD brains, accompanied by increased levels of Lcn2, determine a clear morphological change in mouse primary astrocytes [276]. A recent study found that the iron chelators deferoxamine and deferiprone reduce A β -induced iron accumulation in astrocytes and inhibit A β -induced Lcn2, suggesting these molecules as promising therapeutic strategies against AD [205]. A novel synthesized compound, Glu-DAPPD, containing a glucose group linked to an anti-neuroinflammatory agent, the N,N ′ -diacetyl-p-phenylenediamine, showed in vivo to reduce A β aggregates and immunostaining for astrocytes and microglia, and to improve cognitive function in transgenic APP/PS1 mice being administered chronically for two months [206].\\n\\nRecent studies identified the Janus kinase 2-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (JAK2-STAT3) pathway as a key pathway for the induction and maintenance of astrocyte reactivity. Using adenoviral delivery techniques, authors either downregulated or upregulated the JAK2-STAT3 pathway specifically in hippocampal astrocytes. They found that the JAK2-STAT3 pathway is necessary and sufficient to trigger astrocyte reactivity in the hippocampus of transgenic APP mice, controlling also for gene expression of a variety of genes, of which many involve the inflammatory process. The downregulation of this pathway reduced also A β deposits and improved mice spatial learning but not memory retrieval. On the other hand, the upregulation of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway resulted in opposite and deleterious results [207].\\n\\nAstrocytes are involved in both the production and clearance of ROS, concurring to the oxidative stress found in AD, whose reduction has been tested as a potential therapeutic target. Interestingly, mobile phone radiofrequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) have been shown to reduce both A β and H2O2-induced ROS production in human and rat primary astrocytes, as well as the co-localization between the cytosolic (p47-phox) and membrane\\n\\n(gp91-phox) subunits of NADPH oxidase, indicating the suppression of its activity [212]. Other antioxidant anthocyanin compounds have recently been investigated [277]. Among them, pelargonidin, which acts as an estrogen receptor agonist, has been tested in rats that received an intrahippocampal injection of A β (25-35). Pelargonidin treatment resulted in improved Morris water maze test performance. Higher hippocampal catalase and acetylcholinesterase activities have been detected, accompanied by lower GFAP protein expression, but no change in inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), compared to control animals [213].\\n\\nRecently, the compound monascin has been found to activate the expression of several antioxidative genes such as SOD-1, SOD-2, SOD-3, and HSP16.2 and reduce A β -toxicity in C. elegans strain [214], suggesting its antioxidant potential. In addition, resveratrol [278], tocotrienol [279], epicatechins [280], H-1,2-dithiole-3-thione [281], curcumin, and epigallocatechin-3-gallate [282] have shown in vitro and in vivo anti/oxidant properties in several models of A β -mediated toxicity and AD.\\n\\nAs fundamental regulators of brain homeostasis, astrocytes also regulate the intracellular Ca 2+ concentration through an intermediate conductance calcium-activated potassium channel, KCa3.1. This channel is actively involved in the phenotypic change of astrocytes during astrogliosis observed in AD. By using KCa3.1 knockout mice, memory deficits, neuronal loss, glial activation, tau phosphorylation, and insulin signaling deficits were ameliorated compared with control animals, making this channel an interesting pharmacological target in AD [215]. During the neuroinflammatory process, ATP and ADP are released around plaques, leading to the activation of the metabotropic P2Y1 purinoreceptors (P2Y1Rs) expressed by astrocytes, which increases the rate of spontaneous calcium events [283]. Chronic intracerebroventricular infusion of P2Y1R inhibitors resulted in structural and functional restoration of astrocytes and the preservation of memory deficits [216].\\n\\nSince AD patients show increased levels of the Gs-coupled adenosine receptor A2A in astrocytes, Orr et al. studied in vivo the ablation of astrocytic A2A receptors demonstrating that it enhances long-term memory [284]. The adenosine tone on the astrocytic A2A receptors has also been modulated through a new BBB-permeable equilibrative nucleoside transporter (ENT) inhibitor, J4, tested in APP/PS1 mice. In particular, J4 inhibited the recycling of adenosine from the extracellular space performed by ENTs, resulting in the prevention of the decline in spatial memory, a common feature in AD patients [217]. Additionally, istradefylline, a selective antagonist of A2A receptors, enhanced the performance in behavioral tests in transgenic APP mice [218].\\n\\n## 3.7. Modulation of Astrocytes According to Their Morphofunctional State: The Case of Palmitoylethanolamide\\n\\nIn AD, as in other neurodegenerative disorders, astrocytes undergo morphological, biochemical, metabolic, and transcriptional changes, as well as physiological remodeling. All these rearrangements could lead to either a gain or loss of one or more functions [126]. Thus, pathological changes of astrocytes should not just refer to hypertrophy. Indeed, also morphological atrophy could contribute to AD early synaptic failures and cognitive deficits [126,285]. For these reasons, molecules able to modulate astrocyte morphology and functions according to their reactive or atrophic status could be potentially valuable therapeutics. To the best of our knowledge, the only molecule that has so far shown some indications to exert such effects is palmitoylethanolamide (PEA).\\n\\nPEA is a naturally occurring amide of ethanolamide and palmitic acid, firstly isolated from soy lecithin, egg yolk, and peanut meal. It acts as a lipid messenger that mimics several endocannabinoid-driven actions, even though it does not bind to cannabinoid receptors [286]. We and other groups have shown that PEA exerts anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties in several preclinical models of A β -induced toxicity and AD [287]. PEA in vitro attenuates A β -induced astrocyte expression of GFAP and S100B and the release of pro-inflammatory molecules [273,288]. In a surgical model of A β -neurotoxicity PEA treatment reduced astrocyte hypertrophy and markers of inflammation,\\n\\nincluding iNOS, cyclooxygenase (COX)-2, IL-1 β , and TNFα [289]. PEA also demonstrated the ability to protect A β -induced neuronal reduced viability and loss in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo [208,209,286,289,290]. These results have been confirmed also in primary astrocytes derived from the prefrontal cortex of 3xTg-AD mice, in which PEA promoted neuronal viability [210]. All these reports concurred to demonstrate that PEA exerted these effects through the PPAR α by the use of selective antagonists, corroborated by experiments in models where the receptor was genetically ablated [291-293]. However, studies showed that PEA effects could involve also the orphan G-protein coupled receptor 55 [294], and the transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 channel [295]. Moreover, PEA is able to exert an indirect activation of cannabinoid receptors, via the so-called entourage effect [296], working as a false substrate for fatty acid amide hydrolase, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA) [297]. Indeed, due to the reduction of its catabolism, AEA levels rise. Thus, in turn, AEA could bind to cannabinoid receptors. One additional peculiar feature of PEA is its ability to act as an autacoid local injury antagonist, thus dampening mast cells that are now considered critical effectors during AD progression [298]. In this way, PEA contributes to protecting neurons from excitotoxicity [297]. Interestingly, the modulation of the cross talk between mast cells and glial cells is emerging as a valuable approach to treat several neuroinflammatory brain pathologies, including AD [299]. Some articles present an extensive review of PEA biological functions in the CNS [296,297,300].\\n\\nDifferent formulations of PEA have been synthesized to improve its bioavailability and efficacy, including the ultramicronized (um-PEA) and PEA-oxazoline forms as well as the combination of PEA with luteolin (Lut), an antioxidant compound, ultramicronized together (co-ultra PEA/Lut). Pretreatment with um-PEA of rat hippocampal slices challenged acutely with A β 42 significantly reduced iNOS and GFAP expression [301]. It also restored cell viability of glioma and neuroblastoma impaired by lipopolisaccaride and interferongamma treatment, reducing protein expression of both iNOS and COX-2 [211]. Um-PEA demonstrated oral bioavailability and its chronic administration reduced neuroinflammatory markers and showed neuroprotective effects in 3xTg-AD mice [210,219,302,303]. When comparing hippocampi of 6-month-old with 12-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, the younger animals did not show astrocyte hypertrophy (measured as an increase in GFAP immunoreactivity) but exhibited an ongoing intense neuroinflammatory process with high levels of iNOS, TNFα , chemokines, and interleukins, whereas older mice showed significant astrocyte atrophy without elevation in neuroinflammatory markers. Chronic subcutaneous pretreatment with um-PEA for 3 months prevented the establishment of the phlogistic process in hippocampi of 6-month-old 3xTg-AD mice, compared to vehicle-treated ones. Um-PEA also prevented the altered performance in cognitive tasks and reduced A β formation and phosphorylation of tau protein in the hippocampus [219]. Astrocyte hypertrophy was detected in the cortices of vehicle-treated 6-month-old mice, and um-PEA chronic treatment decreased both GFAP mRNA and protein expression [210]. Interestingly, 3xTgADmice that received um-PEA subcutaneous administration for 3 months, before being tested at 12 months of age, showed restored astrocyte GFAP immunoreactivity to the level of non-Tg controls, also improving their outcome in behavioral assessment of short-term memory [219]. Collectively these reports show that um-PEA acted preventing either astrocyte hypertrophy either atrophy. This indicates that PEA behaved as a modulator of astrocyte morphology and cell reactivity state. This is in accordance with the current view seeing astrocyte reactivity as an evolving and reversible process caused by extrinsic triggers [126,304].\\n\\nAnother formulation that combines the aforementioned PEA effects with the antioxidant actions of Lut has been tested in preclinical AD models. Co-ultra PEA/Lut showed anti-inflammatory and antiapoptotic effects in A β 42-challenged rat hippocampal slices and neuroblastoma cells [301]. In vivo, co-ultra PEA/Lut administration for two weeks in rats that received a single intrahippocampal infusion of A β 42 prevented the A β -induced astrocyte hypertrophy, as well as the upregulation in gene expression of pro-inflammatory\\n\\ncytokines and enzymes found in rats treated with vehicle. Moreover, co-ultra PEA/Lut prevented the A β -mediated decrease in gene expression of both glial-derived and brainderived neurotrophins [35]. Despite having these promising features, no studies have yet elucidated the synergic mechanisms of actions of the association of PEA with Lut. Regardless, since co-ultra PEA/Lut administration started the same day of the surgical infusion, to model the very first phase of A β 42 accumulation as in the prodromal stage of AD, the above-reported study mimicked a potential therapeutic intervention at the earliest stage of the disease. The results support the thesis that targeting astrocytes at the beginning of the pathology could have a positive impact. Other very recent studies endorse this view. Reports from Dr. Escartin's group modulated the activation of astrocytes in 9-month-old 3xTg-AD mice. The downregulation of the JAK2-STAT3 pathway fully restored mice early synaptic and long-term potentiation alterations [207], improved short-term memory, and reduced anxiety behavior [176], thus supporting the hypothesis that targeting astrocytes at the very early stages of AD could be beneficial.\\n\\nThe potential translational value of ultramicronized or co-micronized PEA as a preventive therapeutic strategy in AD is corroborated by its safety and tolerability, as it is already in the human and veterinary market as food for special medical purposes and complementary feed, respectively. Some single or few-cases human studies have been carried out showing favorable results in improving MCI and frontotemporal dementia [305,306], in recovering from stroke [307], and in managing neuropathic pain associated with neuroinflammation [308].\\n\\n## 4. Conclusions\\n\\nDespite the spasmodic basic and medical research and the existence of approved therapies, there is a huge unmet clinical need for effective therapies for AD, especially treatments that are intended to address the biological basis of the pathology to favorably modifying its long-term course. Currently approved drugs do not target the underlying pathology of AD since they only provide modest beneficial effects to a small subset of patients. Moreover, no treatments are available to counteract AD at its earliest stage, which could represent the best timepoint to start therapy. Indeed, A β deposition into amyloid plaques, followed by markers of neurodegeneration, tau pathology, and reduction of brain volume, initiates decades before the onset of observable clinical signs. Dysfunctions of astrocytes have been linked to the molecular alterations observed in AD, thus representing a promising target for disease management. However, morphofunctional changes occurring in astrocytes vary depending on the stage of the pathology. Therefore, molecules capable of correcting dysfunctions of astrocytes could represent a promising pharmacological strategy. Reviewing the literature findings, the only compound so far that seems to exert this effect is PEA. Our previous study indeed showed the ability of PEA to normalize the astrocyte alterations observed in an experimental model of AD, the 3xTg-AD mice, endowed with face, construct, and predictive validities, bringing them back to a homeostatic condition. That and other possibilities of new therapeutic approaches represent an important springboard for the development of therapies for a still incurable disease, such as AD.\\n\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.S.; resources, C.S. and L.S.; writing-original draft preparation, R.F., M.V., and C.S.; figures and tables preparation, G.M., R.F., and M.V.; writing-review and editing, M.V., L.S., and C.S.

Sincere efforts have been made by the researchers globally to identify new targets, discover, and develop novel therapeutic agents for the treatment of AD. This brief review article is intended to cover the recent advances in drug development and emerging therapeutic agents for AD acting at different targets. The article is compiled using various scientific online databases and by referring to clinicaltrials.gov and ALZFORUM (alzforum.org) websites. The upcoming therapies act on one or more targets including amyloids (secretases, Aβ 42 production, amyloid deposition, and immunotherapy), tau proteins (tau phosphorylation/aggregation and immunotherapy) and neuroinflammation in addition to other miscellaneous targets. Despite the tremendous improvement in our understanding of the underlying pathophysiology of AD, only aducanumab was approved by FDA for the treatment of AD in 18\\xa0years i.e., since 2003. Hence, it is concluded that novel therapeutic strategies are required to discover and develop therapeutic agents to fight against the century old AD.\\n\\n## Graphic Abstract\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nKeywords Acetylcholine\\xa0· Alzheimer's disease\\xa0· Beta-Amyloid\\xa0· Neurodegeneration\\xa0· Tau proteins\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Abbreviations\\n\\nACh\\n\\nAcetylcholine\\n\\nAD\\n\\nAlzheimer's disease\\n\\nApoE4\\n\\nApolipoprotein E4\\n\\nAPP\\n\\nAmyloid precursor protein\\n\\nAβ\\n\\nBeta amyloid\\n\\nBBB\\n\\nBlood brain barrier\\n\\nBACE\\n\\nBeta secretase\\n\\nChE\\n\\nCholinesterase\\n\\nCSF\\n\\nCerebrospinal fluid\\n\\nDMD\\n\\nDisease modifying drugs\\n\\nEOAD\\n\\nEarly onset AD\\n\\nFDA\\n\\nFood and drug administration\\n\\nGABA\\n\\nGamma aminobutyric acid\\n\\nGSK3\\n\\nGlycogen synthase kinase 3\\n\\nGWASs\\n\\nGenome-wide association studies\\n\\nIg\\n\\nImmunoglobulins\\n\\nLOAD\\n\\nLate onset AD\\n\\nmAB\\n\\nMonoclonal antibodies\\n\\nMAO\\n\\nMono amine oxidase\\n\\nMSC\\n\\nMesenchymal stem cell\\n\\nMTD\\n\\nMulti target drugs\\n\\nnAChR\\n\\nα 7-Nicotinic ACh Receptor\\n\\nNFT\\n\\nNeurofibrillary tangles\\n\\nNID\\n\\nNew investigational drug\\n\\nNMDA\\n\\nN -Methyl D-aspartate\\n\\nNSAID\\n\\nNon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug\\n\\nODOT\\n\\nOne drug one target\\n\\nOLE\\n\\nOpen label extension\\n\\nPSEN1\\n\\nPresenilin 1\\n\\nRAGE\\n\\nReceptor for advanced glycation end products\\n\\nTKI\\n\\nTyrosine kinase inhibitor\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disease. It severely affects cognitive abilities of a person causing loss of memory and conscience. It is complex, unalterable, and progressive in nature. AD is the prevalent cause of dementia in late adult life and is linked with high morbidity and mortality rate in the elderly [1]. In 1906, the first case of AD was reported by a German psychiatrist and pathologist Alois Alzheimer after whom the disease is named [2]. It is associated with both genetic and environmental factors but the most prominent risk factor is age, and thus it is most prevalent in the older groups [3]. It is one of the most widespread neurodegenerative diseases affecting around 40 million people around the globe and it is expected that more than 100 million people will live with AD by 2050. AD is a progressive and a devastating brain disorder that places a considerable financial burden on the government, families, and individuals. Some of the common symptoms of mild AD\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\ninclude a decline in memory, change in personality, impaired reasoning, poor judgments, and inability to perform normal daily\\xa0tasks, etc. [4]. The key clinical co-pathological indicators (Fig.\\xa01) of AD are the formation of amyloid plaques or senile plaques formed through the accumulation of amyloids in extracellular regions while aggregated hyperphosphorylated tau proteins in the intracellular regions form neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) in affected neurons [5]. Accumulation of amyloid plaques, which primarily contains amyloid beta 40/42 peptides, further leads to neuroinflammation and misprocessing of tau proteins. The MRI scan of the brains of AD patients shows shrinkage of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex regions in comparison to the normal brain (Fig.\\xa01).\\n\\nAD can be classified typically into two types: sporadic and familial. Sporadic AD affects people above 65\\xa0years and is often referred to as late-onset AD (LOAD). Familial forms of AD are influenced by genetic factors and inheritance, the affected group lies between 30-65\\xa0years of age and is referred to as early-onset AD (EOAD) [6]. The Familial type of AD is originated through a rare autosomal dominant mutation occurring in three genes: Amyloid Precursor Protein (APP), Presenilin 1 (PSEN1), and Presenilin 2 (PSEN2) [7]. The majority of AD cases are sporadic and are driven by environmental factors and few genetic influences. A genetic risk factor found in sporadic AD cases through detailed genome-wide association studies (GWASs) is the presence of epsilon 4 allele in Apolipoprotein E4 (ApoE4).\\n\\nThe symptomatic treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors, NMDA-receptor antagonists, and combination therapy are currently approved strategies for AD. However, there are other mechanisms also that contribute to the pathogenesis of AD such as neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, hypoglycemia and vascular dysfunction, metal dyshomeostasis, protein misfolding, clearance of abnormal proteins, etc., and thus are the potential targets for the treatment of AD [8]. The new\\n\\nFig. 1 Illustration  showing  the  comparison  between  the  brain  of  a healthy and an affected one\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\ndisease-modifying drug (DMF) strategies are emerging that target the pathogenic culprits of the disease i.e., extracellular amyloid plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in addition to other miscellaneous mechanisms. This brief review article is intended to review the approved symptomatic therapies, upcoming therapies targeting amyloids, tau\\xa0proteins, neuroinflammation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and miscellaneous targets.\\n\\n## Therapeutic strategies for\\xa0the\\xa0development of\\xa0anti-AD drugs\\n\\nAD exhibits complicated multifactorial pathophysiology which is responsible for the disease being difficult to handle. The AD pathogenesis is associated with several complex pathways including deficiency in cholinergic neurotransmission, defective beta-amyloid (Aβ) protein metabolism (Aβ aggregation), tau protein deposition and phosphorylation (NFT), and the involvement of inflammatory and oxidative pathways [9]. The currently approved drugs act on one target (one drug one target; ODOT) but lately, attention has been paid to multiple therapeutic strategies to design and develop drugs capable of hitting at more than one target [8, 10]. Multi-target drugs (MTDs) are designed by incorporating two or more pharmacophoric structural features of bioactive drugs acting at different targets in a single molecule. These pharmacophoric structural scaffolds can be connected directly (fused), through a tether/linker or merged together. ANAVAX 2-73 and ladostigil are examples of the drugs acting at multiple targets. Ladostigil, a hybrid conjugate (merged) of carbamate rivastigmine and N -propargyl, is a dual inhibitor of cholinesterase (ChE) and monoamine oxidase (MAO) enzymes (Fig.\\xa02). This drug failed to meet its primary endpoint of delaying progression from mild cognitive impairment to AD in second phase 2 clinical trials [11].\\n\\nLumateperone is an example of another multi-target drug that could regulate the levels of several neurotransmitters (Fig.\\xa02). It was evaluated for its efficacy in the phase 3 trial. But, the drug did not meet the primary endpoint and the trial was discontinued in 2018 [12]. Idalopirdine (2-(6-fluoro-1 H -indol-3-yl)-ethyl]-[3-(2,2,3,3-tetrafluoropropoxy)-benzyl]-amine) is a hybrid molecule designed to inhibit AChE and to target 5-HT6 receptors (Fig.\\xa02). It was prepared by incorporating tryptamine moiety, a pharmacophore from 5-HT and a benzylamine pharmacophore from an AChE inhibitor. It received a fast-track designation by FDA in 2016, however it showed weak efficacy in the phase 3 trials and therefore was discontinued [13]. In our opinion, the hybridization approach should be used to fuse, merge or link two or more pharmacophoric motifs acting at more than one target but through the same pathway to obtain MTDs possessing synergistic therapeutic effects.\\n\\nThough MTD strategy is a promising rational approach but an approved drug progressing from clinical trials to market is yet to be developed. As of 4th March 2021, more than 140 agents with the diverse mechanisms of action have been registered in the clinical trials for AD. The result of a search done on clinical trials by entering the term 'Alzheimer's' in the disease field and selecting interventional studies revealed that there are currently 111 clinical studies in phase 2/3 and 29 in phase 3 clinical trials. These interventional studies are evaluating the safety and efficacy of new molecules and repurposed drugs acting on different targets. Majority of the therapeutic agents in the pipeline target amyloids (AChEI, BACE inhibitors) tau proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, metal dysregulation, neuroinflammation and at some miscellaneous targets to reverse the progression of AD. Various therapeutic approaches used to develop agents for AD are illustrated in Fig.\\xa03 and the status of some selected agents tested in clinical trials is presented in Table\\xa01.\\n\\nDrug repositioning and repurposing are the strategies to accelerate the drug discovery and development process. Drug repurposing involves the use of an approved existing drug for some new therapeutic indication, for example, use of remdesivir in COVID-19 [14] while drug repositioning occurs during the development process in biopharmaceutical industries and refers to the development of a drug for an indication different than its original intended indication [15]. Applications of drug repurposing and repositioning to identify novel molecules for the treatment of AD have been reviewed [15-20]. One study reported that approximately 40% of drugs currently undergoing clinical trials for the development of anti-AD drugs belong to the repurposed drugs. More than 3/4 th of these drugs are diseasemodifying agents with the highest representation from hematologic-oncologic agents (20%), cardiovascular drugs (18%), antipsychotic agents (14%) and antidiabetic agents (12%). Some of the repurposed drugs in the pipeline for AD in the phase 3 clinical trials include escitalopram (SSRI, antipsychotic), brexipiperazole (Dopamine   D 2 partial receptor agonist, schizophrenia), masitinib (anticancer), metformin (antidiabetic), guanfacine and losartan (cardiovascular) [16]. Corbett et\\xa0al., in 2012 published an expert Delphi consensus review listing five potential classes of prioritized drugs for repurposing namely, minocycline (tetracycline antibiotic), losartan (angiotensin receptor blocker), nivaldipine (calcium channel blocker), liraglutide or semaglutide (glucagon- like peptides 1) and retinoid therapy for the treatment of AD [21]. Clinical trials of minocycline, nivaldipine, and losartan did not reveal significant benefits in AD patients [22-24]. A recent Delphi consensus process conducted in 2018-19\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nFig. 2 Chemical strategy used to synthesize ladostigil and idalopiridine as multi-target drugs\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nfurther identified three new high priority repurposed drug candidates for clinical trials in AD patients. These molecules were shortlisted based on the preclinical data and include fasudil (a selective inhibitor of rho kinase; ROCK inhibitor), phenserine (AChE inhibitor) and valaciclovir,\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nacyclovir, foscarnet and famciclovir (antiviral drugs). The non-shortlisted compounds included ACE inhibitors (captopril, ramipril, perindopril) and some disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, etc.) [15]. Preclinical studies\\n\\nFig. 3 Various therapeutic approaches used to develop agents for AD\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nindicated that fasudil acts by decreasing the Aβ levels, neuroinflammation and by preventing synaptic damage [25-27]. Antiviral drugs might inhibit Aβ aggregation and abnormal tau phosphorylation induced by herpes simplex virus [28, 29].\\n\\nKumar et\\xa0al., used in silico approach combined with in\\xa0vitro investigation to identify repurposed drugs as AChE inhibitors among the pool of FDA-approved drugs (2369) to treat AD. Based on the virtual screening and in\\xa0vitro analysis, they identified three classes of repurposed drugs viz., thiazolidinedione antidiabetic (rosiglitazone), aminoquinoline antimalarial (hydroxychloroquine), and antifungal drugs (miconazole) as mild to moderate AChE inhibitors [17].\\n\\nStem cell\\xa0(SC) therapy is another upcoming field that has received considerable attention in recent years to treat cancer, blood-related diseases and neurodegenerative diseases including AD [30, 31]. It has shown promising results in AD animal models, preclinical and in early clinical studies especially with regard to reduction in neuroinflammation, increase in neurotransmission, neuronal growth and clearance of proteins, etc. Different type of stem cells such as embryonic SC can mitigate ACh levels [32], induced pluripotent SC can help in regeneration of depleted neural network [33, 34] while umbilical cord blood/placenta and mesenchymal SC can reduce Aβ, tau phosphorylation and reverse microglial neuroinflammation [35]. Several clinical trials (phase1/2) involving autologous adipose tissuederived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), human MSC, leukemia MSC, bone marrow MSC and human umbilical cord blood-derived MSC have been conducted in the AD patients to evaluate their safety and efficacy [36, 37]. Undoubtedly stem cell therapy has the potential to produce disease-modifying effects in AD and therefore cast a ray of hope in a battle against the devastating AD. Though numerous challenges and hurdles (safety, efficacy, genomic instability, reproducibility of cell types, route of administration, optimization of clinical outcome, ethical issues, etc.) are to be overcome before the introduction of this innovative technique into clinical practice.\\n\\n## FDA approved symptomatic therapies to\\xa0treat AD\\n\\nPathways and exact mechanisms leading to AD are still not completely understood resulting in a high rate of failed therapeutic strategies. Presently the symptomatic treatment of the disease to slow the progression of AD is concentrated on three therapies: (a) Cholinesterase inhibitors; (b) N -methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists, and c) combination therapy. The prime cause of AD is the depletion of the neurotransmitter, hence the cholinesterase inhibitors aimed at increasing the amount of ACh, this is achieved through the application of cholinergic inhibitors (viz ., rivastigmine, donepezil, tacrine, galantamine). These inhibitors limit the reduction of ACh concentration in the brain (Fig.\\xa04) [38].\\n\\nIdeally, the NMDA-receptor functions by permitting calcium ions entry for neurotransmission. But in the case of AD, the receptor manifests high activity resulting in overabundance of   Ca 2+ leading to excitotoxicity and cell death [39]. The high activity of the receptor is controlled by an anti-AD drug called memantine that binds to the open state of the NMDA-receptor and functions as a non-competitive antagonist [3].\\n\\nIn combination therapy, a mixture of memantine and donepezil (28\\xa0mg and 10\\xa0mg, respectively once daily) has shown effective results in treating symptoms like cognitive judgment, language, and behavioral problems in the moderate to severe group of AD patients. The results were significantly better than placebo comprising a combination of memantine and placebo [40]. However, the combination was not effective in patients with mild to moderate disease [41].\\n\\nUnfortunately, the currently approved agents offer temporary relief from the symptoms of this complex disease and therefore search is on to discover and develop novel agents for AD therapy.\\n\\n## Upcoming AD therapies targeting amyloids\\n\\nThe amyloid hypothesis describes beta amyloid (Aβ) formation to be one of the major culprits in the pathogenesis of AD [42]. A sequence of proteolysis of APP forms Aβ. This is achieved through two metabolic pathways: the nonamyloidogenic pathway and the amyloidogenic pathway.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nTable 1 Status and mechanism of action of some selected anti- AD

The latter peptide is then cleaved by γ-secretase resulting in the formation of two non-amyloidogenic peptides [43]. In the amyloidogenic pathway, enzyme β-secretase (BACE) cleaves APP into β-APP and a 91 amino acids peptide which comes under the action of γ-secretase forming amyloidogenic peptides namely Aβ40 , Aβ 42 and Aβ 43 [44].\\n\\n## Therapeutics targeting secretases\\n\\nInhibition of BACE is understood to limit the production of Aβ42  [45]. Several agents targeting secretase entered into the clinical trials including CTS-21166 (CoMentis), PF-05297909  (Pfizer),  LY2886721  (Lilly),  AZD3293 (AstraZeneca) [46]. CTS-21166 in the phase 1 clinical trial conducted in young healthy men showed depletion in the amount of Aβ in human plasma [47]. AZD3293 was also reported to exhibit promising results under a combined clinical trial phase 2/3 [48].\\n\\nβ-secretase (BACE) inhibitor Lanabecestat is another orally active BACE-1 inhibitor (AZD3293\\xa0or\\xa0LY3314814). This drug showed excellent results in the preclinical phase. Lilly and  Astra  Zeneca  obtained  an  FDA  track  designation  for this drug in 2016 and in the same year it was advanced to the phase 3 clinical trials. Unfortunately, the two ongoing trials were terminated in June 2018 by the pharmaceutical companies because it was found to be ineffective [49].\\n\\nClinical trials of verubecestat (MK-8931) and elenbecestat (E2609) were also stopped in between due to their efficacy concerns as these drugs did not show any improvement in cognition scores in the subjects [50, 51]. However, the efficacy and safety of oral atabecestat (JNJ-54861911) are currently being evaluated in phase 2/3 clinical trials [52, 53]. It is a thiazine-based small molecule with good blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability. It inhibits APP\\n\\ncleavage by the enzyme BACE and thus reduces Aβ level in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Results of long-term safety and tolerability of atabecestat in the early AD patients evaluated through a randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled study and a two-period extension study showed it to be associated with a trend toward declines in cognition, and elevation of liver enzymes [54].\\n\\nUmibecestat (CNP520) is a BACE inhibitor developed by Novartis for the treatment of early stages of AD [55]. The ongoing GENERATION clinical trial was prematurely stopped in 2019 due to cognitive worsening in the participants [56].\\n\\nγ-Secretase  inhibitors γ-Secretase  is  an  important  target  in  the  pharmacotherapy  of  AD  as  inhibition  of  this enzyme  results  to  a  reduction  in  the  production  of  Aβ. Semagacestat  (LY450139)  is  a  nonselective  γ-secretase inhibitor developed by Lilly. It showed a dose-dependent decrease in the production of Aβ in healthy subjects [57]. Two clinical trials under phase 3 of the same drug were also  prematurely  interrupted  as  patients  suffering  from mild to moderate AD started to show a significant deterioration  of  cognitive  functions  besides  the  risk  of  skin cancer and weight loss [58]. This unfortunate event was caused because γ-secretase also catalyze other transmembrane proteins, one of them being the Notch receptor. Inhibition of notch receptor caused severe hepatic and splenic side effects [59]. Avagacestat, another γ-secretase inhibitor, also failed to show promising results in AD [60, 61].\\n\\nα-Secretase stimulators α-Secretase  stimulation  through activating  protein  kinase  C  has  shown  depletion  in  the levels of Aβ [62]. Etazolate (EHT 0202; ExonHit Therapeutics, Paris, France) a pyrazolopyridine derivative having anxiolytic properties is currently being investigated in clinical trials. It is a promising α-secretase stimulator that has been shown to inhibit Aβ induced cell death and also\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nexhibit a relief in AD symptoms [59, 63]. Acitretin also enhances the α-secretase secretion and is thought to help in the non-amyloidogenic APP pathway [64].\\n\\nEpigallocatechin-gallate (EGCG, Sunphenone) is a polyphenolic flavonoid phytoconstituent found in green tea. It possesses a broad spectrum of bioactivities including  anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective properties [65]. Experimental studies have provided the evidence that it acts by increasing α-secretase cleavage of APP\\n\\nthereby improving cognitive defects in APP/PS1 Mice [66, 67]. It is used as a dietary supplement to combat AD and Down syndrome. It was studied in phase 2/3 clinical trials, but the results were not published. Researchers in Spain started a trial to evaluate the ability of EGCG in the prevention of cognitive decline in ApoE4 carriers with subjective cognitive impairment through a one-year multimodal intervention study [68]. The chemical structure\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nFig. 5 Chemical structure of drugs targeting secretases in AD\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nof drugs targeting secretases in AD have been shown in Fig.\\xa05.\\n\\n## Therapeutics targeting Aβ 42\\n\\nAs discussed above, Aβ 42 is produced under the proteolytic activity of enzymes BACE-1 and γ-secretase. Agents working on these two enzymes would help in the reduction of Aβ42 production. Tarenflurbil is an anti-inflammatory drug chemically related to ibuprofen (Fig.\\xa06). It acts on γ-secretase by allosterically modifying its catalysis of AP and in place of Aβ 42 , Aβ 38 is produced that manifests lower neurotoxicity compared to Aβ 42 [62]. The phase 2 trial showed encouraging results, but the agent because of poor brain penetrability and low efficacy failed miserably in the phase 3 trial as well as in its subsequent phase 3 trials [69, 70].\\n\\nTherapeutics  targeting  formation  of\\xa0 amyloid  deposition/ aggregation A  number  of  therapeutic  agents  have  been developed to target  and  inhibit  amyloid  aggregation.  Two drugs namely tramiprosate and colostrinin showed encouraging  results  in  the  early  phases  of  clinical  trials.  Tramiprosate  (3-amino-1-propanesulfonic  acid;  3-APS;  homotaruine) is an example of a naturally occurring amino acid in seaweed (Fig.\\xa06). It is a structural analog of taurine and GABA. It exerts neuroprotective activity via modulation of GABA receptors. It inhibits  Aβ  aggregation  by  hindering the binding of glycosaminoglycan to Aβ and thereby prevents the formation of β-sheet [59]. The phase 2 clinical trials comprising patients with mild to moderate AD showed a reduction in cognitive loss and an increase in CSF Aβ 42 concentration [71]. The phase 3 clinical trials of tramiprosate couldn't show promising results as were expected, however, the agent limited the hippocampal volume reduction and cognitive loss. In 2018, Hey et\\xa0al., described the discovery, identification and promising results of an ALZ-801, a  prodrug of tramiprostate, in AD [72]. GV 971 (Sodium oligo-mannurarate)  derived  from  brown  algae  is  an  Aβ aggregation inhibitor developed by Shanghai Green Valley Pharmaceuticals,  China  [73].  This  small  molecule  (acidic linear oligosaccharide) possessing anti-inflammatory activity is approved in China for the treatment of mild to mod-\\n\\nFig. 6 Chemical structure of drugs targeting Aβ 42 and inhibiting amyloid aggregation\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nerate AD. However, in US-FDA, it is undergoing phase 3 clinical trials [74]. Results of a 24-week multicenter, randomized,  double-blind,  placebo  parallel  controlled  clinical trial of sodium oligomannate in Alzheimer's dementia showed it to be safe and well tolerated by AD subjects [75].\\n\\nColostrinin is a polypeptide affluent in proline, it is derived from ovine colostrum. It has been demonstrated to inhibit the Aβ aggregation by modulating an innate immune response [76]. Szaniszlo et\\xa0al., highlighted its clinical potential in AD therapy [77]. Colostrinin in Phase 2 clinical trials conducted on patients with mild to moderate AD showed recovery in Mini Mental State Evaluation scores after a treatment period of 15\\xa0months. But the same results were not obtained after 15\\xa0months of consecutive treatment [78].\\n\\nImmunotherapy targeting inhibition of Aβ aggregation Immunotherapy targeted against amyloids is one of the approaches being considered by the concerned authorities to tackle AD. So far, two mechanisms have been elucidated to tackle AD: active immunization and passive immunization. Active immunization is aiming to produce a vaccine against Aβ42 targeting the production of amyloid plaques. Phase 2 clinical trials of a vaccine exhibited better cognitive results as well as reduction of Aβ 42 levels and tau levels, however, the trial was terminated because a number of subjects suffered  from  meningo-encephalitis  after  getting  vaccinated [79].  Passive  immunization  is  focused  upon  monoclonal antibodies (mAB) and the administration of immunoglobulins (Ig). Bapineuzumab, solanezumab, and gantenerumab are currently under investigation and are assumed to show promising results.\\n\\nBapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody ( h mAB). The agent entered phase 3 trials. It showed efficacy in the improvement of cognitive ability in mild to moderate groups of patients.\\n\\nSolanezumab is another anti-amyloid mAB that binds to soluble Aβ peptides. The phase 3 clinical trials lasted 80\\xa0weeks in mild AD carriers. The study showed a significant reduction in cognition and functionality loss, moreover, biomarker findings in CSF showed solanezumab association with its target [80].\\n\\nGantenerumab, an anti-amyloid IgG1 h mAB functions by removing aggregated Aβ plaques through phagocytosis. A phase 2 clinical study (DIAN-TU) was aborted in the early stages as it showed no significant results. The results of randomized and placebo-controlled trials showed that high doses might exhibit some efficacy based on few clinical and biomarker endpoints [81]. The results of GRADUATE studies on the efficacy of a higher gantenerumab dose that most patients received in the DIAN-TU trial are expected in 2022 [81-83].\\n\\nAducanumab (BIIB037; Aduhelm®), an Aβ-targeting drug, has been approved on 7th June 2021 by US-FDA to\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\ntreat AD patients. It was approved using an accelerated approval process making it the first approved therapy for AD since 2003. It is a fully human IgG1 mAB that binds selectively to aggregated Aβ fibrils and reduces the Aβ plaques in the brain of AD patients in a dose and time dependent manner [84]. Biogen carried out a phase 3 randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study (2015-2019; NCT02484547) on aducanumab to evaluate the efficacy and safety in subjects with early AD. However, the study was discontinued due to safety concerns. However, Biogen® initiated another phase 3b open-label study in Jan 2020 for three more years. They recruited 2,400 previous aducanumab trial participants to study only safety and tolerability parameters as primary outcomes (EMBARK). The company also submitted a biologics license application to the U.S. FDA in July 2020 [85, 86]. One of the two phase 3 clinical trials met the primary endpoint having shown a significant reduction in Aβ plaques and clinical decline. The outcome of this study led to accelerated approval of aducanumab for the treatment of AD in 18\\xa0years. However, FDA will continue to monitor the drug after marketing. Biogen is also required to conduct a post approval clinical trial to verify the drug's clinical benefit. The approval may be withdrawn in case the trials fail to verify the drug's clinical benefits [84].\\n\\nLecanemab (BAN2401; mAb 158), a humanized mAB, binds selectively to soluble Aβ protofibrils [87]. Initial clinical studies conducted revealed it to have potential diseasemodifying properties as it significantly slows down the progression of the disease by reducing the Aβ accumulation in the brain. Isai Inc., in collaboration with Biogen® is testing the anti- Aβ protofibril antibody in phase 3 interventional study in the subjects with early AD (CLARITY AD). The study will run till 2024.[88]. Another phase 3 clinical study (AHEAD 3-45) has also been started in US, Europe and several other countries to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy in pre-clinical AD subjects [89].\\n\\n## Upcoming therapies targeting tau proteins\\n\\nNeurofibrillary tangles (NFT) formation is a key indicator of AD pathogenesis; therefore, it becomes imperative for treatment therapies to target tau proteins as well. Strategies so far have targeted tau deposition and phosphorylation along with tau immunotherapy.\\n\\nTherapeutics  targeting  tau  deposition  and\\xa0 phosphorylation Tau deposition and phosphorylation are the two processes that are the culprits in the formation of NFT as well as for the increased neuronal loss. The surged phosphorylation could be controlled through inhibition of enzyme glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3) [90]. Lithium is being considered to  act  as  an  inhibitor  but  failed  to  show  efficacy  in  clinical trials [91]. PKC is stimulated by M1 receptor can also\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\ninhibit  the  enzyme  GSK3,  studies  have  shown  this  might decrease tau phosphorylation and aggregation [92-94].\\n\\nLMTM (LMTX, TRx0237) is an improved derivative of the reduced form of MB (leuco-methylene blue, LMT) in terms of absorption, bioavailability, and tolerability. Leucomethylenthyonium bis hydromethanesulfonate is a secondgeneration, cysteine independent tau aggregation inhibitor. In addition, several studies indicated to inhibit MAO and diminish nitric oxide production. It is currently evaluated in the phase 3 [95, 96].\\n\\nA phase 3 clinical trial with 588 enrolled subjects is currently underway to determine the safety and efficacy of TRx0237 at two doses (16\\xa0mg/day and 8\\xa0mg/day) for AD treatment [97].\\n\\nGandini et\\xa0al., in 2018 identified 2,4-thiadiazolidinedione derivatives to be dual GSK-3β and tau-aggregation inhibitors. The two most potent multitarget compounds were compound   T 1 (( Z )-5-((5-methoxy-1-methyl-1 H -indol-3-yl)methylene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione) and   T 2 (Z)-5-((1 H -Indol-3-yl) methylene)thiazolidine-2,4-dione   (IC 50 of 0.89 and 4.93\\xa0µM for GSK-3β inhibition). Both compounds also improved cell viability, possessed good BBB penetrability and were nontoxic [98].\\n\\nBlarcamesine (ANAVEX2-73) is chemically TetrahydroN,N -dimethyl-2,2-diphenyl-3-furanmethanamine hydrochloride and is an experimental investigational drug against AD. It is a muscarinic receptor agonist and a sigma-1 receptor activator that targets protein misfolding and reduces tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and neurodegeneration in AD [99]. It has been shown to exhibit anti-apoptotic and antioxidant activity. The results of the phase 1 clinical trial conducted in Germany determined 55\\xa0mg to be the maximum tolerated dose in healthy male volunteers. In a phase 2a study, it demonstrated dose-dependent improvement in MMSE ADCS-ADL. Its single daily dose in capsule form is currently being studied in phase 2b/3 for 48-weeks in 450 patients with early AD in Australia at 16 different sites. This open-label extension (OLE) study might expand to include UK and Canada and the results would be available by December 2023 [100].\\n\\nSaracatinib (AZD0530) is a dual kinase inhibitor of Src and Abl family kinases1. It is a repurposed drug originally developed to treat cancer. This small molecule in the preclinical studies was shown to block Fyn in brain slices, prevented synaptic depletion and helped to overcome spatial memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice [101]. In the same mouse line, it boosted hippocampal synaptic density [102]. Van Dyck et\\xa0al. [103] published the results of a randomized clinical trial (NCT02167256) conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and effect of AZD0530 on cerebral metabolic decline in AD. The treatment failed to show a significant reduction in cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) level [103].\\n\\nThiamet G (LY3372689) is a promising O-GlcNAcase (OGA) enzyme inhibitor. It has been demonstrated to reduce tau phosphorylation in tau transgenic model TG4510 [104]. It is currently undergoing phase 1 clinical trials [105].\\n\\nTelmisartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) currently being investigated as a repurposed drug against AD. Scientific evidence indicated that use of ARB in AD may reduce the incidence of cognitive impairment and dementia [106]. It is proposed that it controls cerebral blood flow, protects the cerebral microvasculature, and decreases plaque formation and CSF tau in the brain [107]. It is undergoing phase 2 clinical trials in mild-moderate AD subjects (NCT02085265 and NCT02471833) [108].\\n\\nAtuzaginstat (COR388) is an irreversible inhibitor of lysine -gingipain, the virulence factor proteases found in a P. gingivalis periodontal pathogen detected in the brain of AD patients. P. gingivalis infection in cultured human neurons can cause tau phosphorylation and degradation, synapse loss, and cell death [109]. It's twice-daily dosing is currently being tested in a large phase 2/3 clinical study (GAIN) in subjects with mild -to -moderate AD. Results are expected by the end of Dec 2022 [110, 111]. Recently, in Feb 2021, a partial clinical hold on GAIN was imposed by\\n\\nFDA because few participants developed liver abnormalities. However, it was found that the liver effects are reversible and pose no risk of long-term effects [112]. Chemical structures of several new molecules targeting tau proteins are shown in Fig.\\xa07.\\n\\nImmunotherapy A vaccine  named  AADvac1  is  currently under clinical trials. It functions by promoting the generation  of  antibodies  that  attack  the  conformational  epitopes regions  of tau ,  resulting  in  the  reduction  of tau deposition. The vaccine in humans showed higher efficacy than in experimental animals as the antibodies produced were able to  identify tau proteins  in  mild  to  moderate  AD  patients. The vaccine is currently under phase 2 trial [113].\\n\\n## Drugs targeting neuroinflammation\\n\\nSeveral independent observational studies have demonstrated that anti-inflammatory drugs use is associated with a lower risk of developing AD. A recent prospective, population-based study reported that non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) use in elderly people was associated with 71% decreased risk of AD mortality [114].\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nFig. 7 Chemical structure of new molecules targeting tau proteins\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nALZT-OP1 is a combination regimen of a mast cell stabilizer (cromolyn) and an NSAID to reduce neuroinflammation and to promote Aβ clearance through phagocytosis of Aβ [112]. A phase 3 clinical trial (COGNITE), a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study is evaluating the potential of ALZT-OP1 in slowing down, arrests, or reverse cognitive and functional decline on the CDR-SB in the early-stage AD subjects (NCT02547818).\\n\\nMasitinib (Masivet, Kinavet, AB1010) is a selective tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) known to modulate neuroinflammation mediated by mast cells. Li et\\xa0al., in 2020 demonstrated that chronic treatment with masitinib could restore spatial learning and synaptic density in the hippocampus in the APP/PS1 mouse model of amyloidosis [115]. AB Science® conducted a phase 2b/3 clinical trial from 2012 to 2020 to compare masitinib 4.5 or 6\\xa0mg/kg/day dosing with placebo in 721 confirmed mild to moderate AD subjects receiving a ChE inhibitor and/or memantine in twenty one mostly European countries. The company announced that the study met its primary goal [116].\\n\\nMinocycline a tetracycline repurposed drug possessing anti-inflammatory activity failed to improve the cognitive and functional ability in mild AD patients during 2\\xa0years period in a randomized clinical trial The plausible explanations given by the authors for the failure of this drug in the phase 3 clinical trials were (i) neuroinflammation 'may be a reaction to pathologic characteristics of the disease rather than an important factor in neurodegeneration'; (ii) complex association between microglial activation and neurodegeneration and (iii) 'minocycline did have some efficacy against AD, but treatment effects were too small to be detectable' [22]. Gyengesi and Münch recommended that future trials\\n\\nFig. 8 Chemical structure of molecules a acting as RAGE inhibitor; b α 7-nAChR agonist and c MAO-B inhibitor\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nshould focus on anti-inflammatory drugs capable of decreasing the formation of cytotoxic cytokines [117].\\n\\n## Miscellaneous targets in\\xa0AD\\n\\nAzeliragon (TTP488) is an orally active inhibitor of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE). RAGE is over expressed in the brain tissues of AD patients. Azeliragon has been shown to slow down the progression of AD [118]. It was developed by vTv Therapeutics® (Originator) and was studied in the phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer's type dementia (STEADFAST). The trial was terminated in 2019 due to the lack of efficacy of 5\\xa0mg dose of Azeliragon [119].\\n\\nEncenicline (EVP-6124) is a new potent molecule capable of activating α 7-nicotinic ACh Receptor (nAChR) in the brain at very low concentration and thereby exhibits memory enhancing properties [120]. The drug showed promising results in mild-to-moderate AD patients with respect to placebo on functional and cognitive skills. However, in 2015 FDA imposed a clinical hold based on the outcome of two phase 3 trials owing to its gastrointestinal side effects [121].\\n\\nJ-147 is a new investigational drug (NID) in US for the treatment of AD. It is a curcumin derivative and its chemical name is; N -(2,4-dimethylphenyl)-2,2,2-trifluoroN '-[( E )-(3-methoxyphenyl)methylene]acetohydrazide. The experimental drug is orally active, able to cross BBB with ease and was demonstrated to enhance memory in aged AD mice [122]. It also inhibits MAO-B   (IC 50 =  1.88\\xa0µM). It is currently being tested in phase 1 clinical trial. Chemical structures of agents acting at miscellaneous targets in AD are presented in Fig.\\xa08.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\n## Conclusion\\n\\nAD is a complex neurodegenerative disease affecting millions of people worldwide. Numerous biochemical and pharmacological studies conducted in the past couple of decades have tried to unwind the complexities of this progressive disease. We now have a better understanding of the pathogenesis of AD at the molecular level that has enabled the researchers to discover and develop novel therapeutic agents to treat this devastating disease. A number of therapeutics based on the identified targets were developed from 2010 to 2020 for the treatment of AD and several of these molecules are currently under investigation in clinical studies. Data indicated that over the last decade, the majority of the agents that reached in the phase 2 failed to show a drug-placebo difference and therefore could not make it to phase 3. On the other hand, more than 50 molecules successfully progressed from phase 2 to phase 3 but unfortunately, only one agent could pass the phase 3 clinical trial since 2003. Most of the studies were discontinued/terminated as these agents were found to be toxic and ineffective and thus failed to meet the primary and secondary endpoints of the studies.\\n\\nIn the ongoing clinical trials, anti-amyloid immunotherapy, Aβ aggregation inhibitors, BACE inhibitors, SALA (Selective Aβ 42 lowering agents), tau aggregation inhibitors, α-secretase enhancers, anti-tau immunotherapy and anti-inflammatory agents, etc., have exhibited encouraging results in the initial phases. However, the outcome of these clinical studies would shed more light on the safety and effectiveness of therapeutic agents. Currently, more than 140 drug candidates, mostly drug modifying agents, are being tested in various phases of clinical trials but it is yet to be seen how many of these would progress from the clinical testing phase to the clinical practice.\\n\\nIn our opinion, newer therapeutic strategies to design, discover and develop anti-AD agents should focus on (i) repositioning and repurposing of existing drugs for AD; (ii) multitarget directed ligands capable of acting on multiple key molecular targets involved in the pathogenesis of AD (iii) minimizing the toxicity of drugs failed in phase 3 (iv) improving the pharmacokinetic profile of the promising candidates by structural modification, (v) exploring the natural products to identify the lead molecule for AD, (vi) stem cell therapy, and (vii) identification of novel molecular targets including development of immunotherapy.\\n\\nAcknowledgements Authors would like to thank The Research Council of Oman (TRC) now part of MOHERI for the award of RG project (RGP/HSS/19/232/2019) in call 2019-2020.\\n\\nAuthor contributions SAK, AK and TA carried out the literature review and wrote the manuscript.\\n\\n## Declarations\\n\\nConflicts of interest Authors declare no conflict of interest.\\n\\nConsent for publication All authors have read and approved the manuscript prior to submission.\\n\\n## References\\n\\n1.

The number of patients increases every year worldwide and 5.2 million people in the United States are suffering from AD. This number is expected to expand to 36 million to 115 million in worldwide around the year of 2050 and the estimated economic cost and suffering is increasing greatly (1, 2). Therefore, AD is seemingly insurmountable disease and the increasing numbers of patients produce diverse societal concerns in different aspects.\\n\\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia caused by neurodegenerative process and is tightly related to amyloid β (A β ) and neurofibrillary tangles. The lack of early diagnostic biomarker and therapeutic remedy hinders the prevention of increasing population of AD patients every year. In spite of accumulated scientific information, numerous clinical trials for candidate drug targets have failed to be preceded into therapeutic development, therefore, AD-related sufferers including patients and caregivers, are desperate to seek the solution. Also, effective AD intervention is desperately needed to reduce AD-related societal threats to public health. In this review, we summarize various drug targets and strategies in recent preclinical studies and clinical trials for AD therapy: Allopathic treatment, immunotherapy, A β production/aggregation modulator, tau-targeting therapy and metabolic targeting. Some has already failed in their clinical trials and the others are still in various stages of investigations, both of which give us valuable information for future research in AD therapeutic development.\\n\\nKey Words: Alzheimer Disease; Amyloid Beta-Peptides; Tau Protein; Immunotherapy; Glucose Metabolism; Aggregation\\n\\netiology (4, 9). Disrupted synaptic plasticity, reduced dendritic spine density and memory impairment were proven in rodent model by extraction of A β oligomers from human patients (10).\\n\\nSenile plaques of amyloid β (A β ) in the brain parenchyma have been regarded as not only the main pathological phenomena (3, 4) but also the culprit of this disease according to amyloid cascade hypothesis based on molecular information found in AD study (5). Abnormal production and accumulation of A β in brain parenchyma result in AD pathologies through sequential events by aggregated forms of this protein and the amyloid plaque. A β is generated as a consequence of sequential cleavages of amyloid precursor protein (APP) by β - and γ -secretases (6-8). APP is first cleaved by either α - or β -secretase, and then, the remaining remnants of C83 or C99, respectively, are vulnerable to intramembrane proteolysis by γ -secretase. Amyloidogenic process of γ -secretase cleavage followed by β -secretase produces aggregation-prone A β which are in the center of AD\\n\\nAlong with A β , microtubule-associated protein tau is another major factor of AD pathogenesis as a component of neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) (11). Tau stabilizes microtubule protein and microtubule-associated processes in normal condition. During AD pathogenesis, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated, aggregated and finally accumulated as neurofibrillary tangles (12). Tau hyperphosphorylation and NFT formation is tightly related to the existence of excessive A β and plaques, proving the tau pathology in AD (13, 14). Not only as axonal protein but also as regulator of dendritic function, tau plays a pivotal role, especially mediating early A β toxicity during AD progress (15). Therefore, inevitably, A β and tau became the main targets in drug development. Many clinical trials aiming these two proteins have been performed whereas several lines of targets are still under investigations.\\n\\nUp to date, only a few AD medications have been proved as improving AD symptoms, but none of them modify disease progress or pathological cascades (16). Researchers and clinicians suspect that the reason for many drug target candidates to fail in their clinical trials reside in the improper time of drug treatment, in fairly late stage of AD progression where irreversible damages have already occurred, including excessive A β deposits, neuronal impairment, death and blood brain barrier\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nFig. 1.

Therefore, finding a diagnostic biomarker, especially for the early stages of AD pathology, is desperately needed for developing a valuable therapeutic target at the early stage and preventing progression of the disease.\\n\\nDiverse approaches for AD therapeutic strategy have arisen along with better understanding of cellular and molecular mechanism of AD pathogenesis. In Fig. 1 and Table 1, we listed possible strategies of drug development target based on accumulated scientific findings. In this review, we summarize the recent status of some AD drug targets using different strategies among them from published reports and ongoing clinical studies. In each category, we stated the representative drug targets, preclinical and clinical trials.\\n\\n## ALLOPATHIC TREATMENT FOR AD\\n\\nIn spite of better understanding for molecular mechanism during AD pathogenesis, the available medications for AD up to date provide only symptomatic benefit, not regulate or delay the progression of disease pathology. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved only five medications for AD, including acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (AChEIs: donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and tacrine) and N-methyl-Daspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, such as memantine (18-21). These medications enhance cognitive function via increased acetylcholine level or glutamatergic receptor blocking, respectively. Combined administration of these two medications accelerates symptomatic improvement, representing slow\\n\\nTable 1. Diverse strategies for Alzheimer's disease therapeutic target.

Besides, several lines of regulators for neurotransmission were suggested for symptomatic therapies in AD, including neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor activation (ABT-418), GABAB receptor antagonism (SGS-742) and serotonergic modulation (Lu AE58054). However, they were insufficient to show significant efficacies of symptomatic improvement in clinical trials (24-27). Recently, high affinity 5-hydroxytryptamine (HT) 6 receptor antagonist Lu AE58054 ([2-(6-fluoro-1H-indol-3-yl)-ethyl]-[3-(2,2,3,3,-tetrafluoropropoxy)-benzyl]-amine) was reported to improve novel object recognition task in a rat model with cognitive impairment induced by phencyclidine (28). The combined treatment of Lu AE58054 and donepezil is under phase III clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01955161). Additionally, even drugs with uncertain mechanism were reported to be effective in symptomatic improvement and protection against neurotoxicity by A β , including ethanolic extract of Angelica gigas (INB-176) and Ginkgo biloba (EGb761) respectively, however, none of which showed successful effectiveness in their preclinical and clinical trials (29-31).\\n\\n## A β PRODUCTION/AGGREGATION MODULATOR\\n\\nAbnormal A β production and accumulation in brain parenchyma have been regarded as the central etiological hypothesis in AD pathogenesis (5, 10, 32). Therefore, the first line of strategy was inhibition of A β generation processes to prevent or cure the disease. The tight relevance of α -, β - and γ -secretases to A β production made researchers to discover modulating drugs for these enzyme activities in order to reduce intracellular and extracellular A β level. Whereas effective α -secretase activator was rarely identified, several types of β -secretase inhibitors were discovered and tested, starting with first-generation potent inhibitor OM99-2, OM00-3 (33, 34). Since then, numerous reports and patents of β -secretase inhibition were published, however, finding drug candidate with desirable potencies and efficacy has been fairly challenging (35). Recently discovered MK-8931 (Merck) is a promising β -secretase inhibitor whose result of phase I clinical trial was released in April, 2012. MK-8931 is now under phase II/III trial which was initiated in 2012 (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01739348).\\n\\nGamma-secretase plays the critical role in A β generation, in charge of the rate-limiting cleavage of APP into A β . However, modulating this enzyme activity may cause diverse side effects because of its multiple cleavage actions on diverse substrates which are physiologically important, including notch receptor signaling. For this reason, modulating γ -secretase activity seems to be greatly complicated, requiring restricted substrate specificity for APP to reduce A β only, not affecting other substrate processing such as notch signaling (36, 37). Consequently, substrate specificity is the critical issue in the development of AD therapy using γ -secretase inhibition. Semagacestat (LY450139, Eli Lilly) was a promising drug candidate targeting γ -secretase inhibition (38), tested in two Phase III clinical trials. Even though both trials finished with a disappointing result of insufficient efficacy it showed a breakthrough for possible utilization of γ -secretase modulation in AD therapeutic development.\\n\\nMostly, A β elicits its toxicity by aggregated forms (10, 39, 40). Therefore, the inhibition of A β aggregation is one of the most effective strategies in order to inhibit A β toxicity. Therefore, diverse candidates for inhibition of A β aggregation have attracted attention. Curcumin and β -sheet breaker such as RS-0406 were discovered to inhibit polymerization of A β into oliogmer and fibril forms (41, 42). Compound D737 showed the most effective inhibition of A β aggregation among a collection of 65,000 small molecule candidates and elicited increased lifespan in a Drosophila melanogaster model of AD as well as reduction of A β toxicity in cell culture system (43). Indirect inhibition of A β aggregation was suggested by metal hypothesis of AD (44). Cupper/zinc ionophore, PBT2, which target the copper and zinc ions that mediate A β aggregation was proven to facilitate the aggregated A β clearance in the cortex, to lower A β level of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and to restore the cognitive impairment in AD patients (44-46). PBT2 completed phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00471211) and are now under phase II clinical trial for Huntington disease as well. Additional large-scale clinical tests and high throughput screening for candidates of A β aggregation inhibitor are strongly encouraged in further investigation.\\n\\nVarious modifications of A β peptide have influence on its aggregation and toxicity. Especially, pyroglutamyl modification in N-terminus of A β is critical alteration because pyroglutamated A β (pGlu-A β ) species readily accumulated into senile plaque and vasculature deposit due to increased stability and aggregation velocity (47-49). Glutaminyl cyclase (QC) was demonstrated as the main catalytic enzyme responsible for this pyroglutamyl modification of A β and intracortical microinjection of QC inhibitor, PBD150, significantly decreased pGlu-A β formation (50, 51).\\n\\n## IMMUNOTHERAPY\\n\\nSince inflammation response and activation of phagocytic cells such as microglia and astrocytes had been appreciated as a pivotal contributor to AD pathogenesis, immune system became one of the most prominent targets in the aspect of AD therapeutic invention (52). Cytokines and other neurotoxic adducts secreted by immune-related cells were suspected as possible mediators of neuronal degeneration and cell death (53, 54). Furthermore, data analysis using genome wide association study (GWAS) supported this idea by proving that specific overrepresentation of genes related to immune pathway linked to AD risk (55). The protection effect of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), especially ibuprofen, against AD proved that the suppression of immune response should be beneficial in AD (56). Many factors seemed to be tightly related to the protective effect of NSAIDs against AD, including age of cohort, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, the duration of NSAIDs usage and NASAIDs types,  showing significant effect in APOE ε 4 allele carrier (56-59).\\n\\nUnfortunately, diverse clinical trials with different types of NSAIDs concluded not only beneficial effects but also insufficient efficacies and negative results (57, 60-65). Narrowing down the target along with amyloid hypothesis, immunotherapy against A β peptide attracted a great deal of attention because it is direct resolution of the seemingly main cause of pathogenesis and progression of disease in AD. Several strategies for A β peptide immunotherapy has been tested, including passive immunization with monoclonal antibody against different regions of A β 42 as well as active immunization using synthetic A β 42 (66). Because A β peptide, the major component of senile plaques in AD brain, is regarded as the critical contributor in AD patho-\\n\\ngenesis, enhanced clearance of A β via the administration of anti-A β monoclonal antibody, including bapineuzumab and solanezumab (passive vaccination), or A β antigen with adjuvant such as AN1792 (active vaccination) seemed fairly promising (67, 68). Preclinical trials for both active and passive immunotherapies against A β represented diverse beneficial effects of ameliorated brain A β burden, prevention of memory loss and improved cognitive function in different animal models of AD (67, 69). Preliminary test on human patients exerted promising outcomes of reduced plaque burden and cognitive benefit (70, 71), suggesting multiple mechanisms of actions including modulation of A β equilibrium balance between the central nervous system and plasma (72) or improved peripheral clearance and sequestration of brain A β (73). However, unavoidable side effects found in clinical trials hindered the further clinical development into AD therapeutic treatment on human, including meningoencephalitis, microhemorrhages and vasogenic edema (68, 74). Also, clinical evaluation in human AD patients failed to replicate the identical results as in the animal AD model, showing unsynchronized phenomena between reduced A β plaque and rescue of neurodegeneration during AD progression (75). Immunotherapy is regarded as one of the most promising therapeutic strategies in AD and some immunotherapeutic drug candidates are still under clinical trials, including the first monoclonal antibody for A β protofibril (BAN2401, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01767311) and immunoglobulins combined with albumin by means of diverse application methods (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01561053) (68).\\n\\n## TAU-TARGETING THERAPY\\n\\nIntracellular neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) is another hallmark in AD pathogenesis, cytoskeletal inclusions consisted of hyperphosphorylated microtubule associated protein tau with paired helical filament structure (14). Especially, modulating endogenous tau level in APP-overexpressing mice halted A β -induced behavioral deficit in spite of maintaining high A β level, suggesting the relevance of tau during AD pathogenesis and implying the possibility for tau-targeting immunotherapy in AD (76, 77). Moreover, tight relationship between A β and tau pathologies during AD strengthened the rationale for tau-aiming therapeutic strategy in AD. It was proven by that A β immunotherapy reduced not only the extracellular A β plaques but also intracellular A β accumulation which resulted in the absence of early tau pathology (78). Different mechanistic approaches of tau-targeting therapies were tried, including reducing tau level itself, preventing tau hyperphosphorylation and inhibiting the aggregation (26). Many researches have focused on preventing hyperphosphorylation of tau, earlier event that cause detachment of tau protein from microtubule. Kinases responsible for tau phosphorylation (glycogen synthase kinase, GSK-3 β , cyclin-de- pendent kinase-5, cdk5 and microtubule affinity-regulating kinase) and phosphatase (protein phosphatase 2A, PP2A) are the possible targets to achieve tau-aiming therapeutics, altering tau phosphorylation by modulating activity of the enzymes (79-81). Especially, GSK-3 β inhibition is implicated in both A β and tau pathway concomitantly and is greatly appreciated in AD therapeutic development. GSK-3 β inhibition by lithium, valproate, caffeine were also tested in preclinical and clinical studies and their efficacies were needed to be confirmed in further study because of inconsistent outcomes in different studies (82-85). AZD 1080 (AstraZeneca) and NP-12/Tideglusib (Noscria) were the most promising GSK-3 β inhibitor, however, AZD 1080 was withdrawn from AD therapeutic development due to the nephrotoxic side effect in phase I clinical trials (68, 86, 87). Since then, NP-12/Tideglusib has been recognized as an effective GSK-3 β inhibitor and completed not only pilot clinical study using small sample with the result of positive trends in mini-mental state examination (MMSE), Alzheimer's disease assessment scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog), Global deterioration scale (GDS) and Global cortical atrophy (GCA) (88) but also phase II clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01350362).\\n\\nIn addition to tau phosphorylation, several agents were also suggested to prevent tau aggregation. Methylthioninium chloride (methylene blue, MTC) was the first tau aggregation inhibitor discovered and reduced version of MTC, TRx0237, is now in the process of phase III clinical trial (89) (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01689246). Also, diverse possible candidates were suggested as tau aggregation inhibitor, including anthraquinones, aminothienopyridazines, polyphenols and phenothiazines (68, 90-92). These compounds, however, need more verification because they failed to show consistent efficacies in in vivo studies.\\n\\n## METABOLIC TARGETING\\n\\nSince type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM2) was found to be related to AD, glucose metabolism has emerged as a new interest in AD research. It was widely known that glucose metabolism and insulin signaling are impaired in AD brain (93-95). Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE) was revealed to be responsible for A β degradation as well, more efficiently intracellular A β than extracellular form (96-98). Even though AD and DM2 share IDE as the key metabolic enzyme for their main etiological proteins, A β for AD and insulin for DM2, it is not enough to explain all the AD-mimic pathological phenomena found in diverse mechanism-driven diabetes mouse model with insulin resistance (98-100). Insulin has effect on cerebral function per se and is also tightly involved in inflammation and oxidative stress, representing enhanced inflammatory response and markers of oxidative stress by hyperinsulinemia (101). In other studies, increased autophagosome was suggested to accelerate the amy-\\n\\nloidogenic APP processing in insulin-resistant condition (102). Thereby, insulin itself represented tight relevance to AD and became a new therapeutic target in AD. Metformin, a peripheral insulin sensitizer drug approved by the FDA, was reported to sensitize brain insulin action and prevent AD-associated pathological alteration in in vitro AD model (103). Also, other diverse insulin sensitizers are needed to be tested because they may have possibility to show valuable efficacy in AD as well. MSDC0160 (mTOT modulator, Metabolic Solution Development Company, MSDC) was recently performed successful phase IIa clinical trial for type 2 diabetes (104). MSDC-0160 was demonstrated to elicit its insulin-sensitizing effect through newly discovered mitochondrial target of thiazolinedione (mTOT) located in the mitochondrial inner membrane (104, 105).\\n\\nMitochondria are one of the most devastated organelle in the process of AD development. During AD pathogenesis, mitochondrial impairment occurs in various brain areas, representing not only morphological alteration but also physiological dysfunction (106). A β was detected inside mitochondria compartment of AD mouse model expressing human mutant amyloid precursor proteins (APP), mostly within membrane and membrane-associated region (107, 108). A β seems to accumulate within mitochondria precedent to extracellular A β deposition. Study using mitochondria-specific targeting A β proved that mitochondrial accumulation of A β induced not only morphological alteration but also physiological dysfunction which was fatal enough to induce neuronal apoptosis (109, 110). Other findings also showed morphological alteration of mitochondria and physiological dysfunction, especially electron transport chain through cytochrome C oxidase and increased oxidative stress in in vitro and in vivo AD-mimic system and patients (110112). Therefore, mitochondrial dysfunction by A β is a critical contributor during AD pathogenesis, and in the same line of thought, mitochondrial protection becomes a new strategy in AD treatment. Also, mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress is more evidently the common linker between AD and abnormal glucose metabolism (113, 114). Therefore, mitochondrial recovery drug was proposed as a new concept for AD therapy and treatment of insulin-resistance. Dimebon (Pfizer), originally allergy-treating drug used in Russia, was known to improve ATP generation and energy metabolism in mitochondria and was tested its effectiveness in clinical trial for AD therapeutics (115). Unexpectedly, phase III trial performed with 598 patients ended up as failure with the lack of improvement. This failure leads researcher to suspect the novel mitochondrial mechanism of action of Dimebon, rather than promiscuous clinical effects, including inhibition of histamine H1 and serotonin receptors. In extended thoughts, other medicines with the effect of mitochondrial rejuvenation have been investigated as probable candidates for AD therapeutics. Piracetam is a nootropic drug and has effect on cognitive impairment during aging and dementia\\n\\n(116). The mechanism of action for piracetam was controversial, including effects on glutamate receptors, GABA-mimetic action and activation of calcium influx into neuronal cells (116). Recently, mitochondrial relevance of this drug has been found to enhance the membrane fluidity in brain mitochondria and consequently improve membrane potential, ATP generation and decrease apoptotic vulnerability in aging and AD model (117). These findings suggested the possibility that this drug exerted therapeutic effect through mitochondrial recovery in AD. In addition to mitochondrial function itself, axonal transport of mitochondria through microtubule protein was observed to be impaired in AD (118). This could be another strategic target in AD therapeutic development. The acetylation status of α -tubulin by histone deacetylation (HDAC6) is highly related to cargo transport along microtubules (119). Restored α -tubulin acetylation by HDAC6 inhibitor improves both anterograde and retrograde motility of mitochondria and, furthermore, rescued mitochondrial morphology in hippocampal neurons under AD-mimic condition of A β -induced impairment of mitochondria function (120). These diverse mitochondria-targeting mechanisms of action are all likely to be probable therapeutic mechanism for AD treatment and deserve to be evaluated.\\n\\nBesides the relevance to mitochondrial dysfunction, disturbed glucose metabolism could be directly connected to A β generation and accumulation by modulating the enzyme activity of A β -generating enzyme through post-translational modification. Addition of O -linked β -N -acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to protein is a glucose level-dependent post-translational modification and the specific inhibition of O-GlcNAcase, 1,2-dideoxy2 γ -propylα -D-glucopyranoso-[2,1-d]Δ 2 γ -thiazoline (NButGT), ameliorated A β generation by modulating nicastrin activity, a component of γ -secretase, through S708 site O-GlcNAcylation (121). Different from other O-GlcNAcylation modulating drugs, such as O-(2-Acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucopyranosylidene) amino N-phenyl carbamate (PUBNAc) and Streptozotocin (STZ), NButGT was specific to O-GlcNAcase and showed the lack of cellular toxicity nor insulin resistance (122). Additionally, O-GlcNAcase inhibitor was reported to reduce the tau phosphorylation and improve long-term potentiation (LTP) as well, which are possibly beneficial in AD (123, 124). O-GlcNAcase inhibitor seems to be effective not only in A β generation but also in memory impairment and taupathies, which is needed to be further verified in future clinical studies. In addition to O-GlcNAcylation, diverse post-translational modification could be another valuable target for AD therapeutics, especially specific modification for AD-related proteins, including γ -secretase and β -secretase.\\n\\n## CONCLUSION\\n\\nRecent findings suggest that A β accumulation is fairly slow and\\n\\ntime-consuming process, likely to require more than two decades (125). During this long process, more than one physiological system seems to be linked each other to harmonize in order to induce pernicious AD pathology. Taken information together, it is unlikely that a single remedy could cure AD because of its complexity and intricate relationship among the multitude of pathological components during pathogenesis. For this reason, therapeutic targets for AD should include multiple strategies and combinational remedy, not single, for the maximum effectiveness and better consequences. Also, not only direct therapeutic treatment for pathological intervention but also delaying this long pathogenic process would contribute to reduce the number of AD patients and increase prognostic benefit (26).\\n\\nUp to date, researchers are desperate to find new ways for AD treatment and tune the drug candidates for the maximum efficacies. For instance, in developing A β synthesis modulator as AD therapeutic target, researchers has to consider diverse questions and concerns, including the right margins of decreased A β production level, maintaining proper physiological level and off-target effects by influencing other substrates besides A β . Because it is hard to tune the enzyme activity within the right physiological catalytic range, the successful development of AD therapeutics with enzyme modulator is dependent upon its efficacy on aiming action, specificity and selectivity to target substrate. Also, as everyone agrees that the right timing of drug treatment is essential for the evaluation of efficacies for therapeutic targets, improvement in early diagnostic tool for AD have to be pursued along with AD therapeutic development.\\n\\n## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\\n\\nThis is an invited review a part of which has been presented at the Fourth Academic Forum of the National Academy of Medicine of Korea, held on September 26, 2013 in Seoul, Korea.\\n\\n## REFERENCES\\n\\n1.

In familial, early onset AD, the disease is caused by certain mutations in the genes of presenilins or amyloid𝛃 protein precursor (A 𝛃 PP). Over 95% of AD cases are sporadic in nature and are not caused by any known gene mutations. Both familial and sporadic AD are characterized by two important brain lesions: aggregation of amyloid𝛃 (A 𝛃 ) into amyloid plaques and\\n\\nCorrected Proof Cheng-Xin Gong ∗ , Fei Liu and Khalid Iqbal Department of Neurochemistry, Inge Grundke-Iqbal Research Floor, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, Staten Island, NY, USA Abstract . The amyloid cascade hypothesis has been dominating drug discovery for Alzheimer's disease (AD) for the last two decades. The failure of the development of effective drugs for slowing down or reversing the progression of AD warrants the AD field to consider out-of-the-box thinking and therapeutic approaches. We propose the multifactorial hypothesis of AD, emphasizing that AD is caused by multiple etiological factors, which may result in common brain pathology and functional consequences through several separate but integrated molecular pathways. More than one etiological factor and mechanistic pathway may be involved in a single individual with sporadic AD, and different individuals may have different etiological factors, involving different mechanisms/pathways. We urge the recognition of the multifactorial nature of AD and the paradigm shift of AD drug development from a single target to multiple targets, either with the multitarget-directed ligands approach or the cocktail therapy approach. We believe that patient stratification and the use of the precision medicine model will also benefit AD drug discovery. Keywords: Alzheimer's disease, cocktail therapy, multifactorial hypothesis, multitarget-directed ligands, patient stratification, precision medicine model INTRODUCTION of hyperphosphorylated microtubule-associated protein tau into neurofibrillary tangles. The presence of amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuronal/synaptic loss in the brain are the characteristic histopathological hallmarks of AD.\\n\\n∗ Correspondence to: Cheng-Xin Gong, Department of Neurochemistry, Inge Grundke-Iqbal Research Floor, New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities, 1050 Forest Hill Road, Staten Island, NY 10314, USA.

During the last three decades, many molecular pathways involved in or relevant to the mechanisms of AD have been learned. However, modern AD research has not yet led to the development of any drug that can slow down the progression of AD or cure the disease. Only one drug, memantine, was developed that is still symptomatic and has moderate efficacy in temporarily reducing symptoms for only moderate or severe AD [1].\\n\\nThe failure of developing good effective drugs for AD, despite enormous amounts of resources and effort invested in the last 2-3 decades, led the AD field to think seriously what we have done, where we\\n\\nstand now, and where we should head in AD research. This reconsideration is obviously seen in the last several years and has led many to doubt or even abandon the amyloid cascade hypothesis and shift their efforts to other possible mechanisms or targets, such as tau pathology, for their research and drug development [2-5]. At this transition time for AD research as well as the 110th year anniversary of the first publication of AD by Alois Alzheimer, it is especially timely and important to have a collection of ideas and opinions from AD experts, as organized by the Journal of Alzheimer ' s Disease , regarding the new beginnings of AD research.\\n\\nhave different etiological factors and involve somewhat different mechanisms/pathways. This article discusses the multifactorial mechanism and multitargets for AD.\\n\\n## THE MULTIFACTORIAL HYPOTHESIS OF AD\\n\\nCorrected Proof The failure of AD clinical trials to date could result from many reasons, which have been discussed recently [6-8]. These reasons include the complex nature of the disease, limits of animal models for preclinical studies, inadequate designs of clinical trials, and many others. One important reason is probably the lack of appreciation and understanding of the multifactorial nature and mechanisms of the disease. To date, most AD clinical trials have been based on a single mechanism or pathway. In addition to the dominant amyloid cascade hypothesis [9, 10], several other hypotheses have been proposed for the mechanisms of sporadic AD. These hypotheses include the cholinergic hypothesis [11, 12], tau hypothesis [13, 14], mitochondrial hypothesis [15, 16], oxidative stress hypothesis [17, 18], neuroinflammation hypothesis [19], brain insulin resistance hypothesis [20, 21], brain metabolic hypothesis [22-24], calcium hypothesis [25], innate immunity hypothesis [26, 27], and others. All these AD hypotheses are backed by substantial support from research data. This is actually not surprising because, as an age-associated neurodegenerative disease, many factors may initiate the development of AD and many molecular pathways may mediate the progression of the disease in the aged brain. However, a common problem of these hypotheses is that they intend to overemphasize the specific mechanism/pathway proposed and undervalue other mechanisms and heterogeneity. Such a narrow focus appears to attribute to the failure of AD drug development during the last decades. The development, growth, and maturation of a human body reaches its peak in the third decade of life. Human brain, as a special organ, may further mature for decades due to continuous learning and new experience. However, wearing and aging of the human brain starts at middle age. Normal aging is a constant balancing between physiological aging plus pathological risks/insults and the natural defense mechanisms (Fig. 1A). There are many risks and insults that occur and accumulate during aging, including genetic risks, epigenetic and metabolic factors, and environmental insults. The human body also responds to these factors/insults with its defense mechanisms, which could include general defense and those specific to individual insults. The balance between aging/insults and the defense mechanisms is dynamic and can shift within a certain range under physiological conditions. During normal aging, although the right side of the balance shown in Fig. 1A can be heavier as the accumulation of factors/insults, such as factor A to G, the balance tilts to the right side but still maintains within the normal range. However, as one or more of these factors/insults get heavier or new factors/insults (e.g., factor H, I, etc.) are added up, the imbalance eventually reaches the threshold and breaks the balance, i.e., initiation of the development of AD. These factors/insults collectively result in neurodegeneration, leading to cognitive impairment and eventually dementia, through individual molecular pathways (Fig. 1B). Some of these pathways involve in A 𝛃 overproduction/aggregation and tau hyperphosphorylation/aggregation, leading the formationofamyloidplaquesandneurofibrillary tangles as the two hallmark brain lesions of AD.\\n\\nSporadic AD is caused by multiple etiological factors, which may result in common pathological brain damage and functional consequences through several separate but integrated molecular pathways. The multiple etiological factors and mechanistic pathways are likely involved in a single individual with sporadic AD, and different individuals may\\n\\nOur proposed multifactorial hypothesis can perfectly explain why aging is the most important risk factor for AD, as the defense mechanisms on the left side of the balance shown in Fig. 1A becomes weaker during aging. On the other side, healthy lifestyle, such as physical and intellectual exercises and healthy diet, can help the defense mechanisms and thus inhibit or delay the onset of the disease.\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nMultifactorial mechanisms of AD have been proposed previously, which state that more than one etiopathological factors and mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of AD [28-30]. However, the multifactorial hypothesis of AD that we proposed here is different from those proposed previously. Our hypothesis emphasizes two key concepts for the development of AD. First, we emphasize that the development and onset of sporadic AD result from the collective effects of multiple factors/insults that are not restricted to one or more specific insults. This emphasis warrants targeting more than one insults/pathways simultaneously for effective AD therapy. Second, we emphasize that each individual may have a different combination of etiological factors/insults that cause the onset of AD in this particular individual. This emphasis recognizes the diversity of etiological factors and molecular mechanisms among individual AD cases and justifies the stratification of AD patients and the use of precision\\n\\nCorrected Proof Fig. 1. The proposed multifactorial hypothesis of AD. A) The balance between the potential factors/insults accumulated during normal aging and the defense mechanisms. Worsening of these factors/insults (such as A to G) and/or adding of additional insults (such as H, I, etc.) can initiate the onset of AD. B) The multifactorial insults collectively cause neurodegeneration through multiple molecular mechanisms/pathways and consequently cognitive impairment and dementia. Some of these pathways also lead to the formation of amyloid plaques (AP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT), which are part of the end products of these pathways and also hallmark brain lesions of AD.\\n\\nmedicine concept for the treatment of AD, which will be discussed below.\\n\\nThe previously proposed hypotheses of AD, such as the amyloid cascade hypothesis, tau hypothesis, and neuroinflammation hypothesis, are all supported by more or less experimental and clinical evidence. Our proposed multifactorial hypothesis does not conflict with those hypotheses but include each of them as onefactor/insult for the disease development. Instead, we believe that we need to consider all parts of the issues of AD simultaneously when designing and testing new AD therapeutics. One major problem with previously proposed hypotheses is to emphasize one pathway but overlook or even ignore all others. This problem, in our opinion, partially accounts for the failure of all AD drug development so far.\\n\\nAn overview of the AD clinical trial data indicated that, over the last decade, more than 50 drug candidates have successfully passed phase II clinical trials, but none has passed phase III [31]. According to our proposed multifactorial AD hypothesis, it is not surprising that all the clinical trials targeting to a single pathway or mechanism critical to AD have failed so far. This is obvious because sporadic AD is caused by an imbalance of a collective action of several insults, as shown in Fig. 1. Inhibiting or removing only one of them is unlikely to be sufficient to restore the balance to the normal range. It is time for us to take a paradigm shift for AD drug development to a multitargets approach on the basis of the multifactorial AD hypothesis (Fig. 2).\\n\\nCorrected Proof Each factor/insult of the right side of the balance of Fig. 1 may have different weights and contribute differently to the initiation and development of sporadic AD, and in different individuals the weight of each factor/insult may be different. Extensive research accumulated during the last three decades suggest many important factors/insults. They include aging, as well as genetic, epigenetic, metabolic, and environmental factors. Some of these factors/insults, such as mutations of presenilins and A 𝛃 PP, appear to be so strong that they can lead to early onset familial AD without co-existing of other insults. However, in most ADcases, amyloid or tau pathology is insufficient to lead to sporadic AD, as these pathologies can also be seen in the brains of individuals without cognitive impairment. STRATEGY TO TARGET THE MULTIFACTORIAL MECHANISM OF AD It is generally much more difficult to design a drug that can act at multiple targets. However, this is not impossible. A few groups in Europe and China have started the approach of multitarget-directed ligands (MTDL) for AD drug development [32-36]. The aim of MTDL design is to combine features that can interact with two or more of the desired targets. The MTDL molecules can be conceived to directly interact with multiple targets associated with ADby the molecular hybridization of different pharmacophoremoieties from already identified bioactive molecules [37, 38]. Each pharmacophore of the new hybrid drug can preserve the capacity of interacting with their specific sites on the targets and thus generate multiple specific pharmacological responses, which would enable the treatment of multifactorial AD. The development of MTDLs can prevent the challenge of simultaneously administering multiple drugs with potentially different degrees of bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and metabolism. Thus, this pharmacological approach can also provide patients with a simplification of the therapeutic regimen. Another approach, which is probably more practical, is to select substances of multiple actions against various insults/mechanisms involved in AD from nature sources. There are several natural compounds, such as isaindigotone, chelerythrine, chalcone, coumarin, huprine, curcumin, rhein, berberine, and resveratrol derivatives, that deserve investigation for AD drug development. This approach may indicate new directions for the development of new anti-AD drugs.\\n\\nFig. 2. Proposed strategies for AD drug development on the basis of the multifactorial hypothesis.\\n\\nThe third strategy is to consider simultaneous treatments with more than one drugs targeting various insults/mechanisms according to the multifactorial AD hypothesis. Such an approach had been used effectively in chemotherapy and in fighting against HIV/AIDS as the cocktail therapy. The cocktail therapy is proved to be essential to such an infective disease with a clear single cause, infection with the HIV virus. It actually makes more sense to employ such an approach for fighting\\n\\nagainst AD, a disease with multiple etiologies and mechanisms.\\n\\nAnother important strategy for AD drug discovery is to stratify AD patients based on their likely factors/insults and test AD drug candidates in the stratified population of AD patients. Because the sporadic AD can be caused by a combination of various etiological factors and different molecular mechanisms/pathways may dominate in different populations, AD can be categorized into different subgroups, and different subgroups likely represent different etiopathogenic mechanisms and possibly also somewhat different clinical profiles. On the basis of the levels of tau, ubiquitin, and A 𝛃 1-42 in the cerebrospinal fluid, we were able to stratify AD patients into at least five subgroups [39]. Importantly, each of these five subgroups presented a different clinical profile. A recent study demonstrated structural variation in A 𝛃 fibrils from AD clinical subtypes [40], suggesting some molecular and structural basis for ADsubgroups. Therefore, testing a specific drug candidate in the stratified subgroup of AD patients, rather than the mixed populations of all AD patients, will certainly increase the likelihood of success in clinical trials. With the latest advances of brain imaging techniques and AD biomarkers, stratification of AD cases is now already feasible and will soon become more practical.\\n\\nPrecision medicine is a new medical model that proposes the customization of medical treatment and care to the individual patients. This model has been used successful for treating certain cancers [41]. In light of the unsuccessful investment of vast amount of effort and resources for AD drug discovery in the last two decades, it is time to make a paradigm shift and consider the precision medicine model for AD drug discovery and for future management of AD patients. Our knowledge of the disease-causing mutations of PSEN1, PSEN2 , and APP for familial AD and of ApoE alleles and polymorphisms of some genes, such as TREM2 , as risk factors for sporadic AD already maketheuseofprecision medicine model for treating AD possible. Brain imaging and biomarker data can add additional values for customization of individual AD patients.\\n\\nCorrected Proof Initial efforts on the multi-target strategy for treating AD are mainly focused on the development of compounds that have ChE inhibitor activity (tacrineand donepezil-related derivatives) plus one or more properties of anti-A 𝛃 aggregation, 𝛃 -secretase inhibition, promotion of non-amyloidogenic cleavage of A 𝛃 PP, MAO inhibition, neuroprotection, anti-oxidation, metal-chelating, NMDA (N-MethylD-aspartate) antagonist, nitric oxide-releasing, antiinflammatory, tau hyperphosphorylation inhibition, and binding to serotonin receptors or opioid sigma 1 receptors. Tacrine is among the most popular pharmacophores used for the design of MTDLs since it is very active cholinesterase inhibitor. There is also a number of hybrid compounds containing fragments of donepezil, galantamine, or memantine. The pharmacologies and initial evaluations of these compounds have been recently reviewed by Guzior et al. [42] and Ismaili et al. [43] and thus are not discussed here in detail.\\n\\n## MULTI-TARGETS FOR TREATING AD: CURRENT STATUS\\n\\nThe multifactorial nature of AD means that there are many potential therapeutic targets. Targeting these targets individually with current drugs has been ineffective for AD in clinical trials. A possible answer lies in a polypharmacological approach to modify activities of several of these targets simultaneously, especially those associated with the pathogenesis of the disease. The main therapeutic targets currently under investigation for treating AD include key proteins (A 𝛃 and tau) and their processing, receptors (cholinergic, glutamatergic, serotoninergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic, histaminergic), enzymes (cholinesterase [ChE], 𝛂 -, 𝛃 -and 𝛄 -secretase, monoamine oxidases [MAO], O-GlcNAcase), and pathways/processes (insulin signaling, excitotoxicity, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, neurogenesis, calcium and metal homeostasis, endoplasmic reticulum, and mitochondrial damage), all of which have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of AD.\\n\\nExamples of these hybrid compounds under investigation comprise the dual binding site of ChE inhibitors with additional properties such as antiA 𝛃 aggregating activity [44, 45], neuroprotective and antioxidant activity [46, 47], calcium channel blocking [48, 49], cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonism [50], BACE-1 inhibition [51, 52], histamineH3receptorantagonism[53],NMDAreceptor channel blocking [54], serotonin 5-HT3 receptor antagonism [55], or serotonin transporter inhibition [56]. Other examples of dual-acting ligands are MAO-B inhibitors with iron-chelating agents [57], metal chelators with BACE-1 inhibitors [58], metal chelators with antioxidants [59], and modulators of\\n\\n𝛄 -secretase with PPAR 𝛄 activities [60]. Most of these multifunctional ligands have been shown to display biological activity in vitro and require verification in animal models. However, several compounds like bis(7)-tacrine [61], ladostigil [62, 63] and memoquin [64] showed promising activity in vivo and in preclinical or even clinical studies.\\n\\nCorrected Proof Several groups have synthesized and assessed compounds bearing the N-benzylpiperidine group present in donepezil and the N-propargylamine motif present in PF9601N, a potent and selective MAO-B inhibitor with neuroprotective activities in vitro and in vivo [34]. Both scaffolds were linked by different heterocyclic ring systems, such as pyridine, indole or 8-hydroxyquinoline, allowing facile synthesis of different MTDL molecules for AD therapy. In addition to inhibiting ChE and MAO, some of these new MTDL molecules also have antioxidant, anti-A 𝛃 -aggregating, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic, and metal-chelating properties. Preclinical studies suggest that these MTDL compounds can target the multiple pathways involved in the pathogenesis of ADandthusrepresent a potential improvement of the current pharmacological therapy of AD. One example of MTDL model that progressed to clinical trials against AD is ladostigil, designed to inhibit MAO and ChE but also incorporating potent anti-apoptotic and neuroprotective activities [63]. The MTDL attempt combining activities of MAO and ChE has been reviewed recently [65]. The use of the well-known AD drugs donepezil, tacrine, or rivastigmine [47, 66] and bioactive natural products such as curcumin [67], berberine [68, 69], or 8-hydroxyquinoline [70]; as structural scaffolds for the development and search of new chemical entities with multiple properties for the treatment of AD has been investigated. These new hybrid compounds should be considered as simplified versions or lead drugs possessing potential as real alternatives to the current unsuccessful drugs for treating AD. Another approach for the multi-target AD drug development is repurposing, i.e., the development of existing or abandoned drugs for new indications, related to the original purpose or after off-target effects are identified by data mining. Repurposing can reduce the time to launch, cost of development, and the uncertainty associated with safety and pharmacokinetics. Data mining is a way of using preexisting knowledge about molecules and applying it to develop new drugs [71]. The most promising drug currently being investigated for repurposing is rasagiline, a selective, irreversible MAO-B inhibitor Another example of repurposing for AD treatment is anti-diabetic drugs. Diabetes is a known risk factor of AD, and brain insulin signaling is deregulated in AD[74, 75]. Our preclinical studies using AD mouse models indicate that several anti-diabetic drugs, including insulin sensitizers and intranasal insulin, are promising for reduction of AD-like brain pathologies and cognitive impairment [76, 77]. Studies on the repurposing of anti-diabetic drugs for the treatment of AD was reviewed recently in detail [78]. A phase II clinical trial of intranasal insulin administration in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and mild to moderate AD showed improved delayed memory and preserved caregiver-rated functional ability and general cognition [79]. Long-acting intranasal insulin detemir also improves cognition for adults with MCI or early-stage AD [80]. A recent randomized, doubleblind, placebo-controlled phase II trial also found that the treatment of MCI or mild to moderate AD patients with daily intranasal regular insulin for two to four months improved memory associated with preserved brain volume on MRI and reduction in the tau-P181/A 𝛃 42 ratio [81]. Three GLP-1 (glucagonlike peptide 1) analogs, which are used for treating diabetes, have shown in vivo benefits in mouse AD models [82] and potential therapeutic value in AD [83]. Liraglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that can cross the blood-brain barrier [84], ameliorate ADassociated brain pathologies and improve learning and memory in animal models [85-87]. This antidiabetic drug prevented the decline of brain glucose metabolism, synaptic dysfunction, and disease evolution of AD in a 6-month small clinical trial [88]. A multicenter randomized double-blind placebocontrolled phase IIb clinical trial for AD is currently undergoing (https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/ NCT01469351). The GLP-1 analog Exendin-4 was also evaluated in a Phase II clinical trial (see https:// www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT01255163), but the results has not been published at the time of preparation of this article.\\n\\nfor the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The repurposing for AD was due to its ability to regulate the non-amyloidogenic processing of A 𝛃 PP [72]. Rasagiline also has a neuroprotective activity due to the propargylamine moiety that activates Bcl-2 and downregulates the Bax proteins [73]. One phase II trial of rasagiline sponsored by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries was completed without publication of the results, and another phase II trial sponsored by the Cleveland Clinic is undergoing (https:// www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct/show/NCT02359552).\\n\\nA few clinical trials have started to evaluate drug candidates in stratified AD patients with benefits. For example, a small clinical trial testing intranasal insulin in MCI and AD patients found that the treatment facilitated recall on two measures of verbal memory in memory-impaired ApoE4 carriers [89]. Insulin also differentially modulated plasma A 𝛃 according to ApoE genotype. Another trial testing the long-acting intranasal insulin, detemir, in MCI and AD cases found that the treatment enhanced memory for ApoE4 carriers but worsened it for noncarriers [80]. In a recent prevention trial for MCI and dementia, the subjects were stratified into four cohorts on the basis of age, ApoE genotype, sex, education, family history of dementia, vascular risk, subjective memory concerns, and baseline cognitive performance [90].\\n\\nsince all single AD drug clinical trials have failed to date.\\n\\nThecompletionofhumangenomestudyandrecent advances of brain imaging and biomarkers have made the stratification of AD patients for both clinical trials and future treatments not only possible but also practical. Computational and mathematical models based on individual genomic, epigenomic, neuroimaging, and biomarker data can optimize the stratification of AD patients for better therapeutic outcomes. These models can also serve for the precision medicine model for individual AD patients for customized medical treatment.\\n\\nCorrected Proof CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES To date, most pharmacological research is driven to discover highly selective drugs. This strategy has failed to develop any drugs that can slow down or stop the progression of AD. The recognition of the multifactorial nature of AD warrants a paradigm shift of AD drug development from a single target into multiple targets, either with the MTDL approach or the cocktail approach. The therapeutic potential of multi-targets for the treatment of complex neurodegenerative diseases like AD must be recognized. Patient stratification and the use of precision medicine model will certainly benefit both single and multi-targets AD drug discovery. While there are many potential targets for disease-modifying drugs, it is important to prioritize and test which combinations will work. It seems logical that the pathways involved in synaptic and neuronal loss, rather than the deficiencies caused by cell death or AD lesions, must be targeted in order to slow down or reverse the disease progression. Of course, targeting a combination of both would theoretically relieve symptoms and prevent further neuronal loss. Therefore, combination of pharmacophores interacting withbothsymptomaticanddisease-modifyingtargets is highly justified for the initial research of MTDLs for AD. An international Alzheimer's Precision Medicine Initiative (APMI) was recently established through a collaboration of leading interdisciplinary clinicians and scientists devoted to the implementation of precision medicine model for fighting against AD [91, 92]. The successful implementation of this model in AD will likely result in breakthrough therapies with optimized safety profiles, better responder rates and treatment responses. Development of an effective drug for treating AD is clearly very challenging. Our experience indicates that there is no simple way of searching for AD therapy. The recognition of the multifactorial hypothesis of ADandtheconsideration of using the multi-targets approach gives hope for developing new and effective therapy for AD.

Most clinical trials targeting the classical hallmarks of this diseaseβ -amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles-failed, showed discrete clinical effects, or were accompanied by concerning side effects. There has been an ongoing search for novel therapeutic targets. Neuroinflammation, now widely recognized as a hallmark of all neurodegenerative diseases, has been proven to be a major contributor to AD pathology. Here, we summarize the role of neuroinflammation in the pathogenesis and progression of AD and discuss potential targets such as microglia, TREM2, the complement system, inflammasomes, and cytosolic DNA sensors. We also present an overview of ongoing studies targeting specific innate immune system components, highlighting the progress in this field of drug research while bringing attention to the delicate nature of innate immune modulations in AD.\\n\\nKeywords: Alzheimer's disease; innate immunity; neuroinflammation; therapeutic targets\\n\\n## 1. Introduction\\n\\nDue to advances in healthcare and increased longevity, societies of all industrialized and non-industrialized countries are seeing a significant increase in the prevalence of common neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). These devastating disorders represent the biggest challenge and an immense economic burden for all health systems around the world. AD is the most common neurodegenerative disorder characterized by a progressive neuronal loss that leads to a decline in memory and other cognitive functions, i.e., dementia, culminating in the loss of independence in activities of daily living. To illustrate the potential magnitude of AD's impact, epidemiologists have estimated that the global prevalence of AD in people older than 65 years will rise to 150 million by 2050 [1]. This alarming estimation shows the urgency to develop novel strategies for the prevention and treatment of this gigantic public health challenge.\\n\\nHistologically, AD is defined by two core neuropathological hallmarks: the accumulation of extracellular amyloid β (A β ) plaques and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) formed by misfolded and hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein [2]. However, classical neuropathological features begin even decades before the first cognitive symptoms manifest [3]. Additionally, the pre-pathological stages of AD are thought to be characterized by latent neuroinflammation [4], alterations in the blood-brain barrier [5], accelerated cellular senescence [6], and dysfunction of the glymphatic system [7]. This cellular phase occurs alongside the processing and accumulation of A β aggregates. According to the current but debated hypothesis, A β triggers tau pathology. The neuroanatomical spread of misfolded tau species correlates tightly with the clinical progression of the disease [8].\\n\\n<!-- image -->\\n\\nCitation: Serradas, M.L.; Ding, Y.; Martorell, P.V.; Kuli´ nska, I.; Castro-Gomez, S.

Current Therapies: Limitations of Past and Current Strategies\\n\\nically. Anti-muscarinic compounds (rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine) alone or in combination with the N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor modulator memantine were for years the only approved supportive pharmacological therapies for mild-tomoderate dementia due to AD, showing a minimal e ff ect in the progression of cognitive decline or delay for nursing home care [13]. With this limited drug repertoire, the research and development of AD therapies focused for decades on targeting classical neuropathological hallmarks, mainly A β processing. However, discouragingly for the entire fi eld, all Physicians and healthcare providers are still treating AD patients merely symptomatically. Anti-muscarinic compounds (rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine) alone or in combination with the N-Methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor modulator memantine were for years the only approved supportive pharmacological therapies for mild-tomoderate dementia due to AD, showing a minimal effect in the progression of cognitive decline or delay for nursing home care [13]. With this limited drug repertoire, the research and development of AD therapies focused for decades on targeting classical neuropathological hallmarks, mainly A β processing. However, discouragingly for the entire field, all clinical trials with small molecules targeting the amyloid cascade (e.g., BACE1 inhibitors) or active immunization against A β failed to reach any significant clinical endpoint. Several of these clinical trials were even stopped due to worsening cognitive outcomes or serious side effects [14]. These disappointing results have led to questioning the amyloid hypothesis and rethinking clinical trial design as well as diagnostic methods.\\n\\nThe very recent approval by the USA Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of two monoclonal antibodies against A β for passive immunotherapy (lecanemab and donanemab) has raised some hope for an era of disease-modifying therapies. These molecules showed a high efficacy in removing A β detected with Positron emission tomography (PET) tracers. However, this passive immune therapy shows only marginal but statistically significant slowing in some clinical parameters that measure independence in daily life activities and cognitive deterioration when the treatment is initiated in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild dementia [15,16]. These results suggest that anti-A β therapies must be begun in the asymptomatic and pre-pathological phases of the disease or that A β may contribute only partly to AD pathogenesis. Additionally, amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) of edema and effusions are detected in more than 20% of patients receiving these immunotherapies, especially those carrying the APOE4 gene variants. These inflammatory changes are triggered by the targeted A β aggregates on the blood vessel walls and lead to an increased risk of serious adverse events such as cerebral bleeding [17]. Furthermore, the estimated cost of these therapies, including follow-up diagnostic workups, is calculated at more than 20,000 USD yearly per treated patient. This elevated bill represents insufficient cost-effectiveness for health systems and has halted the approval by the European Union and the United Kingdom [18].\\n\\nThe current panorama of disease-modifying therapies in AD is incipient but optimistic. Prospective long-term studies in pre-symptomatic patients are still necessary to determine whether anti-A β passive immunotherapies are effective as a feasible preventive option. Additionally, novel targets based on different hypotheses must be explored, including the inflammatory hypothesis of AD.\\n\\n## 3. Neuroinflammation as a Central Mechanism in AD\\n\\nOver the last few decades, several investigations have demonstrated that in addition to A β plaques and NFTs, the brains of AD patients exhibit sustained low-grade inflammatory responses even in the pre-pathological phases of the disease [19]. Inflammation is a crucial defense mechanism of the brain against infections, toxins, and injuries. However, a sustained imbalance between anti- and pro-inflammatory signals can lead to chronic neuroinflammation, characterized by the activation of glial cells and the release of cytokines and chemokines, that when not ceased, have detrimental effects on the CNS. In the context of AD, it was initially believed that sustained inflammation in the brain was merely a passive response or consequence triggered by the neuronal loss characteristic of the disease, together with the emergence of A β plaques and NFTs. However, contrary to previous assumptions, numerous studies now emphasize that neuroinflammation in AD contributes significantly, possibly even more than the plaques and tangles themselves, to the disease's progression [19,20].\\n\\nThe notion that inflammation might contribute to AD pathology was first proposed by a pioneering study by McGeer et al. in 1993 [21]. The findings from a small, placebocontrolled, double-blind trial investigating the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) indomethacin in AD patients suggested that NSAID intake slowed cognitive deterioration over the six-month trial period, whereas the placebo group showed a decline as expected. This trial brought to light two significant observations: the presence of reactive microglia in AD brains, suggesting chronic inflammation, and the observation that individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, who frequently use NSAIDs over long periods, had a reduced risk of developing AD [21,22]. Subsequently, in 2000, Akiyama et al. proposed in their review 'The Inflammatory Hypothesis of Alzheimer's Disease', which provided a comprehensive revision of the role of inflammation in AD, that chronic neuroinflammation contributes significantly to the pathogenesis and progression of the disease [23]. Since then, a growing body of literature has underscored the significance of neuroinflammation as one of the central cellular and molecular mechanisms that drive disease initiation and progression, shedding light on promising avenues for future research and therapeutic interventions.\\n\\nThis pivotal and independent role of the immune system and neuroinflammation is supported by the extensive and reproducible results from multiple genome-wide association studies (GWASs), as more than half of enrichments in AD-risk genes are found in this category or in pathways mainly related to microglia/myeloid function. Furthermore, rare ADrisk variants (i.e., TREM2 , CD33 , ABCA7 , PLCG2 , and ABI3 ) have been found in genes mainly expressed in myeloid cells [24]. Moreover, all non-genetic risk factors for developing AD are to some extent related to neuroinflammatory responses. For example, aging is a low-grade chronic inflammatory condition and the most important environmental risk factor for AD [25]. Mild-to-moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI) comes in second place as the most important non-genetic, non-aged-related risk factor for developing dementia and AD. Secondary damage after TBI is characterized by sustained neuroinflammation and the aggregation of misfolded proteins that may trigger AD and other neurodegenerative disorders [26]. Other inflammatory conditions associated with a higher risk of developing ADare systemic infections [27,28] and obesity in middle age [29]. Additionally, immunerelated proteins and cells, such as microglia and inflammasome complexes, have been found in close proximity to AD neuropathological hallmarks such as A β plaques, further highlighting the involvement of neuroinflammation in AD pathogenesis [20].\\n\\n## 4. Targeting Inflammation and the Immune System in AD\\n\\nResearch into novel immune targets against Alzheimer's disease (AD) continues to evolve, with a focus on identifying the key cellular and molecular pathways involved in neuroinflammation and immune dysregulation. The emerging immune targets being investigated for AD include the following.\\n\\n## 4.1. Microglia\\n\\nMicroglia, as the main resident immune cells of the CNS, play a pivotal role in innate immunity and brain inflammation, as well as within the context of AD [10,24,30,31]. Under normal conditions, microglia remain in a 'homeostatic state', characterized by ramified morphology with small somas. In this state, they continually survey the environment, communicating with neurons and other glial cells through various signaling mechanisms. Upon detecting threats such as the invasion of pathogens, injury, or pathological protein aggregates, microglia undergo activation, marked by morphological changes: the retraction of processes, enlargement of the cell, and eventually proliferation and migration to the lesion site, where they initiate an innate immune response [32]. The detection of pathological triggers is mediated by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), encompassing both pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from pathogens and damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from stressed or dying cells. DAMPs include various molecules like stress-induced proteins, mitochondrial components, nuclear proteins, and DNA. Upon ligand recognition, PRRs and other DAMP-sensing receptors initiate intracellular signaling pathways, culminating in the transcription and release of innate immune mediators such as complement factors, cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors [4]. PRRs are widely expressed by various cell types in the central nervous system, including microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, endothelial cells, and even neurons to some extent. These receptors comprise different families, including toll-like receptors (TLRs), C-type lectin-like receptors (CLRs), nucleotide-binding domain with leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors (NOD-like receptors or NLRs), retinoic acid-inducible gene-like receptors (RLRs), absent in melanoma 2 protein-like receptors (ALRs), and cytosolic DNA receptors (CDSs). While TLRs and CLRs are membrane-bound, the others are cytoplasmic receptors [4].\\n\\n## 4.1.1. The Role of Microglia in Alzheimer's Disease\\n\\nIn AD, microglial activation is hypothesized to be primarily driven by the presence of A β oligomers and fibrils decades before the formation of A β plaques. These oligomeric forms are recognized by PRRs and other DAMP-sensing receptors, including RAGE, CD36, CD14, CD47, and toll-like receptors (TLR2, TLR4, TLR6, and TLR9) [33,34]. While activated\\n\\nmicroglia initially phagocytose A β , prolonged activation may lead to their enlargement, impaired A β processing, and plaque formation. Early in AD pathogenesis, the immune response can facilitate A β clearance, showing positive effects on AD-related pathologies in animal models. However, sustained activation of the immune response, characterized by microgliosis and pro-inflammatory signaling, can exacerbate AD pathology and neural death [20,35]. The depletion of microglia in an A β -amyloidosis model (5xFAD) induces a profound shift from parenchymal amyloid plaques to cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) [36,37]. Mice whose microglia were chronically depleted presented accelerated mortality, brain calcifications, a decline in white matter integrity, and neurodegeneration in aging [38]. These results indicate that microglia are essential in keeping the integrity of brain networks during aging and actively participate in the aggregation and formation of A β -amyloid plaques by mechanisms that still need deeper investigation.\\n\\n## 4.1.2. Microglia Modulators against Alzheimer's Disease\\n\\nThe survival and proliferation of microglia during development and in the adult brain are dependent on colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R), whose cognate ligands are CSF-1 and IL-34. CSF1R can be inhibited by several compounds already tested in preclinical settings, such as PLX3397 (pexidartinib) [39], PLX5622 [40], BLZ945 [41], Ki20227 [42], JNJ527 [43], ARRY-382 [44], and GW2580 [45]. Although the chronic and complete depletion of microglia using these inhibitors can bring the aforementioned deleterious side effects, the transient and partial depletion of microglia in several models of AD seems to exert beneficial outcomes. Eliminating 50 to 80% of microglia in 5xFAD mice rescues dendritic spine loss, reduces overall inflammation, and improves cognitive deficits [36,46-48]. Early treatment of 6-month-old APP/PS1 mice with GW2580 for 3 months inhibits normal microglia proliferation with an overall reduction of 30% and prevents synaptic degeneration and behavioral deficits without affecting amyloid levels [49]. Similar effects can be achieved in transgenic models expressing frontotemporal dementia (FTD)-associated MAPT mutations. Eight-month-old P30IS mice treated with JNJ-527 show a reduction in microglia of approximately 40% with a subsequent decreased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, reduced neuronal death, and rescued motor neuron degeneration [43]. The use of PLX5622 in the 3xTg-AD model with a reduction in microglia of approximately 30% has also been shown to prevent microglial association with plaques and improve hippocampal-dependent memory deficits [40]. Furthermore, stimulating microglia proliferation by injecting CSF1 weekly in the APPSwe model prior to cognitive impairment prevents further memory deficits and decreases A β deposits [50]. The modulation of microglia proliferation and survival by targeting CSF1R not only demonstrates the essential role of these cells in pre-pathological stages of AD but also proves that eliminating 'senescent' microglia or stimulating the proliferation of new homeostatic microglia may be a feasible strategy to prevent AD pathology.\\n\\nDuring physiological conditions, microglia are constantly surveilling neuronal networks and brain structure stability through the sensing of neuronal milieu and by establishing transient but constant physical contact with synaptic structures, blood vessels, and other brain cells [51]. The mechanisms by which microglia homeostasis is induced or maintained remain underexplored. IL-10, Cluster of Differentiation 200 (CD200 or OX-2 membrane glycoprotein), and CX3CL1 (fractalkine) are some of the proposed main molecules that prevent microglia hyperactivation under homeostatic conditions.\\n\\nIL-10 is a homodimeric polypeptide of 17 kD, usually produced by immune cells (T cells, B cells, macrophages, and other hematopoietic cells) after their activation. The IL10 signal is transduced through a dedicated receptor (IL-10Ra) and an accessory co-receptor (ILa-10Rb) which leads to the JAK/STAT pathway and dampens cytokine gene expression and antigen presentation [52]. In vitro, IL-10 decreases the proinflammatory activity of microglia and other glial cells [53]. Similarly, the activation of the IL-10R on microglia prevents hyperactivation in a model of septicemia [54]. Moreover, Il10 gene deficiency potentiates LPS-induced tau pathology in non-transgenic mice [55]. In a counteractive manner, the\\n\\nconstitutional removal of the il10 gene ameliorates phagocytic deficits of microglia and mitigates A β -amyloidosis, CAA, and cognitive deficits in APP/PS1 mice [56]. The viral transduction of IL-10 in the brain of AD mouse models has resulted in conflicting outcomes. While the intrahippocampal application of adenovirus-associated virus vectors expressing IL-10 (AAV-IL-10) in transgenic APP mice (Tg2776) exacerbates A β plaque burden and memory deficits [57], the injection of a similar vector mediating IL-10 overexpression in the hippocampi of APP-PS1 mice showed enhanced neurogenesis and an improvement in spatial learning deficits [58]. Although conflicting, the targeting of IL-10 pathways may have therapeutic consequences for AD. Further studies are necessary to determine the critical window and duration for the treatment based on this target.\\n\\nCD200 is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that is commonly expressed in T cells, B cells, dendritic cells, and neurons [59]. The expression of the CD200 receptor (CD200R) is mainly found in myeloid cells (microglia, macrophages, and dendritic cells), but also in astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. The CD200-CD200R interaction exerts an inhibitory effect on microglia, likely by triggering the intracellular phosphorylation of Dok1 and Dok2 and the further inhibition of the Ras-PI3K and Ras-ERK pathways, as well as the subsequent inhibition of pro-inflammatory signals through the downregulation of NFκ B [60]. In Cd200 -/ -mice, the microglia exhibited a hyperactivated phenotype, and injured Cd200 -/ -neurons elicited accelerated microglial responses [61]. In AD patients, CD200 and CD200R are found to be downregulated in postmortem brain tissue [62], and the viral expression of CD200 in the hippocampi of APP/PS1 mice improves cognitive functions by promoting synaptic plasticity [63]. These preliminary results encourage the development of future trials based on the modulation of the CD200-CD200R pathway.\\n\\nAnother microglia modulator extensively studied over the last few decades is the chemokine fractalkine or C-X3-C motif ligand 1 (CX3Cl1), the expression of which is abundant in neurons [64,65]. In homeostatic conditions, CX3Cl1 is found as a membraneanchored protein, but under inflammatory challenges, it is cleaved by metalloproteases such as disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10) and ADAM17 [66]. The anchored and soluble CX3Cl1 (sCX3Cl1) binds to a unique G proteincoupled receptor (CX3CR1) that activates several pathways, leading to increased calcium concentrations in the microglia cells. The fractalkine/CX3CR1 axis plays an essential role in CNS development [67,68] and the physiological maintenance of neuronal network stability and synaptic plasticity in the adult brain [69,70]. It also exerts modulatory effects on microglia activity, acting as an anti-inflammatory during acute neuroinflammation [71-74]. In AD patients, CX3Cl1 is found to be upregulated in postmortem brain tissue of early pathology stages, especially in the cortex, and correlates with the progression of tau pathology [72]. Similarly, sCX3Cl1 increases in the CSF and blood of patients with mild cognitive impairment due to AD [75]. The role of the fractalkine/CX3CR1 axis in AD is still under debate since cx3cr1 knockout ( cx3cr1 -/ -) has shown opposite effects in amyloidosis and tau pathology models. While cx3cr1 -/ -decreases A β plaque burden in APPPS1, R1.40 [76], and APP/PS1 mouse models [77], the constitutional cx3cr1 deficiency worsens tau pathology in the hTau model [74,78] and accelerates the spread of tau aggregates [79]. Additionally, the AAV-mediated overexpression of sCX3Cl1 in the hippocampi of rTg4510 mice slows tau pathology and neurodegeneration without having any behavioral effect [80]. In 3xTg-AD mice, a combined model of β -amyloidosis and tauopathy, the constitutive lack of the cx3cr1 gene prevents neuronal loss [81].\\n\\nSeveral pharmacological modulators of the fractalkine/CX3CR1 axis have been developed in recent years. One of the most promising is the small allosteric CX3CR1 antagonist AZD8797 [82], whose neuroprotective effect has been demonstrated in rat models of chronic-relapsing multiple sclerosis [83] and acute spinal cord injury [84]. Additionally, the synthetic peptide Tet34 derived from the CX3CL1 intracellular domain [85] and E6011, an inhibitory monoclonal antibody against CX3CL1, are being investigated in preclinical and clinical studies of peripheral inflammatory diseases. E6011 has shown a long-term safety\\n\\nprofile in randomized clinical trials for rheumatoid arthritis [86]. These novel treatments remain to be tested in preclinical and clinical AD studies and may represent an attractive option for future research.\\n\\n## 4.2. Triggering Receptor Expressed on Myeloid Cells 2 (TREM2)\\n\\nTriggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREMs) constitute a family of cellsurface receptors found widely across myeloid cells. Initially, the discovery of TREM1 unveiled its role as an immune response amplifier, particularly in enhancing granulocyte and monocyte reactions to microbial stimuli. Since then, the TREM family has expanded to encompass proteins expressed not only on granulocytes and monocytes but also on macrophages and dendritic cell (DC) lines. Broadly, TREMs serve as modulators, dictating the threshold and duration of myeloid cell responses [87]. One prominent member of this family, TREM2, which operates as an activating receptor found on tissue macrophages, both on their surface and within intracellular reservoirs, has received great attention in the context of AD. TREM2-positive macrophages include microglia within the central nervous system, osteoclasts in bone tissue, and various macrophage subsets distributed in the liver, adipose tissue, skin, gut, and tumors. TREM2 binds to microbial lipids such as bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and non-glycosylated mycolic acids found in mycobacteria. Additionally, TREM2 has been reported to engage with proteins prone to aggregation and accumulation in neurodegenerative disorders. Notably, TREM2 has an affinity for A β peptides [88]. This multifaceted binding profile underscores TREM2's pivotal role in orchestrating immune responses, particularly in the context of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative diseases like AD [87,89].\\n\\nThe signaling pathway of TREM2 in the brain involves the initial binding of TREM2 to ligands, such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylethanolamine [90], low-density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein E (ApoE) [91], or A β peptides [92], which triggers conformational changes and facilitates its interaction with adaptor proteins like the DNAX activation protein of 12kDa (DAP12). This interaction leads to the phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation (ITAM) motifs within DAP12 by Src family kinases. Phosphorylated ITAMs serve as docking sites for cytoplasmic signaling molecules, including Syk kinase. Syk kinase activation triggers downstream signaling cascades, leading to the activation of various intracellular pathways such as the PI3K-Akt pathway, MAPK pathway, and NFκ B pathway. The activation of these signaling pathways culminates in gene expression programs and cellular responses such as cytokine production, enhanced phagocytosis, and the regulation of inflammatory responses. Tight regulation by negative feedback mechanisms ensures the proper control of TREM2 signaling to prevent excessive or dysregulated immune responses, underscoring its critical role in maintaining brain homeostasis and health [4,87,89].\\n\\n## 4.2.1. Role of TREM2 in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis and Progression\\n\\nIn AD, TREM2 has garnered significant attention due to its critical role in the brain's immune response and its potential involvement in clearing A β plaques. In fact, TREM2 has been shown to be involved in A β pathology regulation, the hyperphosphorylation of tau protein, and microglia activation [88]. More than 60 different genetic variants have been identified in the TREM2 gene and linked to several neurological disorders, but the most commonare linked to an increased risk of developing AD [93-95]. The most notable TREM2 mutation variant is the R47H (Arg47His), characterized by a substitution of histidine for arginine in position 47 of the TREM2 protein. This variant has impaired binding capabilities to cells, ApoE, and damage-associated lipids or apolipoprotein ligands [96]. Additionally, R47H may confer a loss of TREM2 function, leading to a reduced clearance of A β peptides and other toxic substances. Epidemiological studies have shown that the R47H variant is enriched in AD cases and less prevalent in cognitively normal controls. The R47H variant may contribute to an earlier age of onset in AD, in addition to an increased risk of AD. Another prominent TREM2 mutation that disrupts its binding capabilities to cells and ApoE,\\n\\nbut not to lipid ligands, is the R62H (Arg62His) variant. Epidemiological studies have shown a mild increased risk of AD in individuals harboring the R62H variant. Another variant, the H157Y (His157Tyr), has also been associated with AD. This mutation is located in the stalk domain of TREM2, specifically, in the cleavage site of metalloproteases ADAM, resulting in the increased shredding of TREM2 and reduced cell surface expression. This variant has a deleterious and damaging impact on the functions of TREM2 and significantly increases AD susceptibility in carriers, although it is rarely found in AD patients. Other TREM2 mutations that have been associated with AD, although less common in the general populations, are D87N (Asp87Asn), T96K (Thr96Lys), L211P (Leu211Pro), and R136Q (Arg13Gln) [97].\\n\\nThe role of TREM2 in AD pathophysiology is currently not fully understood. In studies conducted by Wang et al. [98,99], the authors demonstrated that Trem2 deficiency in mouse models of AD ( Trem2 -/ -5xFAD mice) resulted in a reduced clustering of microglia around A β plaques, leading to larger, more diffuse, and less dense plaques. Furthermore, they observed that these altered A β plaque characteristics were associated with increased toxicity to neural processes, as evidenced by a higher number of dystrophic neurites and hyperphosphorylated tau in Trem2 -/ -5xFAD mice compared to 5xFAD mice. The increase in dystrophic neurites suggests greater damage to neuronal processes, including axons and dendrites, in the vicinity of A β plaques in the absence of TREM2. Similar findings were observed in the research by Yuan et al., in which Trem2 deficiency interfered with the development of a neuroprotective microglia barrier, responsible for managing amyloid compaction and insulation [100]. These findings suggest that microglia expressing TREM2 play a crucial role in packing A β plaques and preventing damage to adjacent axons and dendrites, highlighting TREM2's protective role in the early stages of A β deposition and limiting its spread and toxicity [98-100].\\n\\nHowever, in other disease models, such as APPPS1-21, Trem2 haplodeficiency has variable effects on A β accumulation as demonstrated by studies conducted by Jay et al. [101,102]. The authors showed that the complete deletion of Trem2 in this model ( Trem2 -/ -APPPS121) reduced A β burden at early stages but led to higher A β accumulation later on. This indicates that TREM2 deficiency can ameliorate amyloid pathology and be actually beneficial at early stages of the disease in APPPS1-21 mice but can be detrimental and exacerbate the disease as it progresses [103]. These contradictory findings between studies have raised questions within the field about whether Trem2 deficiency has model-specific effects or different roles at various stages of pathology, given that the mice were examined at different points in the disease's progression [101]. Despite these contradictions, there is a consensus that Trem2 deficiency reduces microglia cell accumulation around plaques and attenuates inflammation-related gene expression [98,99,102]. Therefore, further research into the role of TREM2 in the context of AD is crucial, as it may reveal new therapeutic strategies.\\n\\n## 4.2.2. Therapeutic Targeting of TREM2 against Alzheimer's Disease\\n\\nAlthough a great interest in TREM2 as a therapeutic target for AD is emerging, it remains a challenging task, since TREM2 risk variants are found in less than 1% of the population, and it is still unknown whether potential TREM2 targeting could be effective in non-carrier AD patients [88]. Furthermore, the strategy for either activating or inhibiting TREM2 must be determined since different outcomes have been observed depending on the disease model used, the stage of the disease, and the pathological insult being studied. As previously mentioned, TREM2 activity ablation in the 5xFAD model has been shown to increase the burden and early onset of the pathology. Whereas, in other models, TREM2 ablation seems to have beneficial effects at earlier stages of the disease. Regardless of these concerns, TREM2 continues to attract interest due to its clear connection with the outcome and progression of AD. To date, the best strategy appears to involve stimulating TREM2 signaling in the early stages of the disease, before or at the beginning of amyloid deposition, and before tau pathology and neuronal loss. This approach leverages TREM2's role in microglial stimulation and the transition from a homeostatic to an active state, which helps\\n\\ncontain plaque formation, density, and size [88]. Modulation of TREM2 expression has been shown to decrease inflammation and phagocytosis promotion in vitro. Moreover, in vivo experiments showed that lentiviral approaches aiming to promote TREM2 overexpression in mice brains attenuated cognitive and neuropathologic alterations [104,105].\\n\\nImmunotherapies using antibodies to stimulate TREM2 signaling are being developed. Schlepckow et al. developed the monoclonal antibody IgG1 (mAb) 4D9 that binds to and blocks the cleavage site of TREM2, stabilizing the protein and allowing its constant activation. The authors reported enhanced microglia capacity to engulf A β and neuronal debris and a reduction in amyloid deposition in a concentration-dependent manner [106]. This strategy is reported to be in initial clinical trials in combination with transferrin receptors that facilitate the crossing of the blood-brain barrier [107]. Another immunotherapy approach involves the activation of the TREM2 extracellular domain via the mAb IgG1 AL002, developed by the company Alector. Studies conducted by Wang et al. have shown a reduction in plaque size and better compaction in vivo [108]. In vitro studies using AL002 have demonstrated the activation of the TREM2 in microglia and an increase in their proliferative state. Currently, AL002 is in phase II of clinical trials, and it seems to be safe and well tolerated by participants, including healthy individuals and AD patients (NCT05744401).\\n\\nAnother immunotherapy strategy, developed by Fassler, et al. is CGX101, an mAb IgG4 anti-TREM2 that aims to target the extracellular domain of TREM2 and shed TREM2 to constrain long-term chronic inflammation due to the activation of TREM2 by the agonizing mAb, as well as attenuate non-specific proinflammatory effects. Studies of CGX101 in vivo and in vitro have shown a reduction in amyloid burden in 5xFAD mice at early and later stages of the disease. Increased activated microglia coverage of the plaques, reduced cognitive decline, and reduced neuroinflammatory markers together with a reduction in dystrophic neurites were also observed [109].\\n\\n## 4.3. The Complement System\\n\\nThe complement system is an ancient component of the immune system [110]. The discovery of the first complement proteins dates back to the late 19th century [111-113]. The modern terminology was concerted based on the order of reactions: C1, C4, C2, C3, C5, C6, C7, C8, and C9 in 1968 by the Complement Nomenclature Committee [114]. Beyond the classically described cascade, the integrated human complement system consists of more than 50 proteins, most of which are secreted by the liver and several of which can be differentially induced in a variety of other cell types and tissues, including the brain [115]. They are found either circulating in the blood or lymph or expressed on cell surfaces and, in some cases, on or in subcellular compartments [116,117]. The complement system is an integral part of the innate immune response and acts as a bridge between innate and acquired immunity [118]. The complement cascades can be initiated almost immediately upon pathogen entry and play a crucial role in controlling the early stages of infection. Three distinct activation pathways have been classically described; however, in reality, these pathways are closely interlinked [119]. Antibody-dependent activation, first described at the beginning of the 20th century, is now termed the classical pathway. The re-discovery in the 1950s of an antibody-independent, pathogen-triggered pathway for complement activation laid the foundations for the so-called alternative pathway. A third activation pathway, antibody-independent and triggered by pathogen-specific sugars, was described in the 1980s and is now known as the lectin pathway.\\n\\nHowever, the complement system is multifunctional and far beyond infection defense. For example in the CNS, it was demonstrated to be fundamental in several physiological processes [120], including shaping neuronal networks during early development through highly controlled synaptic pruning [121], assisting in appropriate neuronal migration, polarization, and proliferation [122,123], and influencing neuronal excitability through the modulation of neuronal intracellular calcium transients [124]. In the adult brain, the complement system has a significant influence, as the forgetting of remote memories relies on a complement-dependent synaptic elimination mechanism mounted by microglia [125].\\n\\nThe complement system as a fundamental part of the innate immunity is a double-edged sword that usually protects the host but, under chronic or overactivation conditions, can cause tissue damage such as in the case of neurodegenerative conditions [126].\\n\\n## 4.3.1. Complement System in Alzheimer's Disease\\n\\nThe complement system has been increasingly implicated in the pathogenesis of AD. While the complement rarely constitutes the sole driver of disease, it acts as an initiator, contributor, and/or exacerbator in numerous disorders [127]. Its contribution to pathology and dysfunction is complicated by region- and time-specific activation as well as differences in animal models used to investigate these processes [128]. A bioinformatic analysis by Xi-Chen Zhu et al. confirmed that more than 20 genes were closely related to differentially expressed complement system components in AD after intersecting the disease-related complement system module genes and differentially expressed genes [129]. In many CNS diseases, complement proteins are significantly upregulated before signs of neuronal loss occur, which suggests that the reactivation of mechanisms similar to complement-mediated synaptic elimination may drive disease progression [121].\\n\\nSynapse loss is considered the strongest neurobiological correlate of cognitive impairments in AD [130,131]. According to current findings, C1q and C3 play an important role in this process, probably through direct binding to their receptors at synapses or transport via extracellular vesicles from microglia and astrocytes to synapses [132-134]. C3, the central component of the complement system, has also been reported to impact synaptic density impairment through the neuronal complement receptor C3aR in the astrocyteneuron co-culture system [135]. An essential role for C3 in promoting microglia-dependent synapse elimination during aging has been confirmed in aged c3 -/ -mice, which display attenuated synaptic elimination in the hippocampus resulting in improved cognitive performance [136]. In addition, complement proteins found on synapses may also be synthesized within neurons or synapses [137]. Whether complement proteins deposited at synapses in ADcome from the neurons themselves or from glial cells remains to be clarified. A recent study showed that the optogenetic activation of microglia promoted the clearance of A β in the brain parenchyma, but also increased synaptic elimination. The researchers further demonstrated that this synaptic elimination was dependent on C1q [138].\\n\\nThe first piece of evidence linking the complement to AD came from studies, in which plaques and periplaque areas stained positive for complement proteins and activation products [126,139]. A study by Spurrier et al. showed that inhibiting oligomeric A β -mediated neuronal damage prevented C1q deposition at the neuronal synapse, resulting in attenuated pathology and cognitive decline in mouse models of AD [140]. C1q, the initiating protein of the classical complement cascade, is increased and associated with synapses before plaque deposition [141]. It regulates phagocytosis and synapse clearance by microglia, contributing to synapse loss in AD patients [142]. Notably, early and locally produced C1q in response to injury, without the coordinated expression of other complement components, may have a protective role and limit the progression of disease [128,143-145]. Downstream complement activation leads to neurotoxicity [128]. Moreover, the classical complement system can also be activated by p-tau found in NFTs [146]. The activation of the classical complement pathway leads to the deposition of C3b, formation of the C3 and C5 convertases, and production of C3a and C5a anaphylatoxins. The role of C3aR in AD is complex, as reported data have suggested both protective and detrimental effects. For example, the genetic ablation of C3ar1 ameliorates disease in tauopathy models [147], but it also enhances neurogenesis in the adult brain [148]. This dual role for the complement in AD has wide therapeutic implications.\\n\\n## 4.3.2. Complement-Targeting Therapy in AD\\n\\nThe increasing number of complement-targeting drugs that have been approved or are in advanced clinical trials is encouraging and starting to benefit a growing number of patients. However, none of the approved complement-targeting drugs have been yet tested\\n\\nin AD patients [110]. Inhibitors of complement activation have been studied in animal models. Treatment with a C5aR antagonist decreases pathology and enhances behavioral performance in murine models of AD. C5a and fibrillar A β together injure neurons more than either protein alone. The additive damage to neurons can be blocked by PMX53, a C5aR1-specific antagonist [149]. Research by Fonseca et al. showed that the oral delivery of a cyclic hexapeptide (PMX205), another C5aR1 antagonist, for 2-3 months resulted in a substantial reduction in pathological markers such as fibrillar amyloid deposits (49-62%) and activated glia (42-68%) in two mouse models of AD [150]. An improvement in the passive avoidance behavior task in Tg2576 mice was correlated with reduced pathology. In 3xTg-AD mice, PMX205 also significantly reduced p-tau (69%) [150]. Similar results were found recently by Gomez-Arboledas et at. in the Tg2576 mouse model [151]. Additionally, the intermittent oral administration of an additional C5a receptor antagonist (EP67) has been shown to enhance microglia phagocytosis and subsequently reduce A β and astrocytosis and rescue memory deficits and synaptic markers in 5xFAD mice [152]. Taking together these results, it is safe to propose that the use of already approved C5aR1 antagonists such as Avacopan (ChemoCentryx) must be tested in preclinical and clinical studies of AD patients.\\n\\nAnother complement-based target in AD is the natural inhibitor component 8 gamma (C8G), whose expression has been found to be upregulated mainly in astrocytes of postmortem tissue of AD cases. The intrathecal delivery of recombinant C8G in 5xFAD mice ameliorated neuroinflammation and behavioral deficits, whereas C8G knockdown exacerbated AD pathology [153]. Targeting the complement system seems to be a feasible and promising strategy for future clinical trials in the preclinical phases of AD, especially considering the vast repertory of compounds already tested or being tested in other immune-related conditions.\\n\\n## 4.4. Inflammasomes\\n\\nThe most well-understood PRRs involved in neurodegeneration are the TLRs, CDSs, NLRs, and ALRs, which can form inflammasome complexes. Inflammasomes are multiprotein complexes that play a central role in the innate immune response by regulating the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and initiating inflammatory responses. They act as a molecular platform within cells, particularly immune cells, in response to various danger signals, including microbial pathogens, toxins, and DAMPs [154]. Inflammasome complexes typically consist of three key components: a cytosolic pattern-recognition receptor or sensor molecule, the enzyme caspase 1 or effector molecule, and an adapter protein that enables contact between the two, known as an apoptosis-associated speck-like protein with a CARD (ASC). There are various types of inflammasomes, which differ in the composition of their sensor molecule and in the requirement or lack thereof for an adaptor molecule [154,155]. The NLRs contain a carboxy-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain, a conserved central NACHT domain (essential for protein oligomerization and required to form multiprotein inflammasome complexes), and a variable amino-terminal domain that defines several NLR subfamilies. NLRs carrying an N-terminal pyrin domain (PYD) make up the NLRP subfamily, while NLRs with an N-terminal caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) constitute the NLRC subfamily. NLRPs rely on the adaptor protein ASC, which is also referred to as PYCARD because it contains two domains, a pyrin domain (PYD) and a CARD, acting as a molecular platform that connects the PYD of the NLRP sensor with the CARD of pro-caspase 1. Conversely, NLRCs can directly interact with pro-caspase 1 through their respective CARD domains, rendering ASC unnecessary for inflammasome activation. The NLRP1 downstream pathway stands as the sole exception to the conventional activation of NLRPs, as it, along with the NLRCs, does not require the adapter to interact with pro-caspase 1 [154,156,157].\\n\\n## 4.4.1. Inflammasome Activation\\n\\nInflammasome activation typically follows a two-step process. The initial step, known as 'priming', involves the activation of cell surface receptors like TLRs upon exposure to danger signals. This triggers the activation of the myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88)-nuclear factorκ B (NFκ B) pathway, leading to the transcription and synthesis of key inflammasome components and precursor forms of pro-inflammatory cytokines. The second step encompasses the assembly and activation of the inflammasome complex itself. Upon the detection of danger signals, the sensor molecule undergoes conformational changes and recruits ASC, facilitating inflammasome assembly. Once assembled, the inflammasome activates pro-caspase-1, initiating its cleavage. Activated caspase-1 processes pro-inflammatory cytokines such as pro-IL-1 β and pro-IL-18 into their active forms, IL-1 β and IL-18, respectively. Simultaneously, caspase-1 cleaves the protein Gasdermin-D, leading to its activation and insertion into the cell membrane, forming pores. These pores facilitate the release of IL-1 β , IL-18, and other intracellular contents, triggering inflammation and attracting immune cells to the site of infection or injury. Sustained pore formation results in cellular swelling and ultimately pyroptosis, a highly inflammatory form of cell death [154,158,159]. In addition to the inflammasome complex formation, inflammasome activation can also result in ASC 'specks' formation as the adapter protein ASC can get polymerized and aggregate via homotypic interactions between its PYD domains into large fibrils. These ASC fibrils cross-link via interactions between its CARD domains, forming supramolecular aggregates called 'specks' that serve as platforms for the further recruitment of caspase-1, enhancing the inflammatory response [160-162].\\n\\n## 4.4.2. Relationship between Inflammasomes and Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis and Progression\\n\\nThe concept of inflammasomes playing a role in propagating inflammation and exacerbating the course of diseases was first proposed by Jürg Tschopp and colleagues in the early 2000s [163,164] when they elucidated the structure and function of the first inflammasome NLRP1, demonstrating their involvement in inflammatory processes associated with various diseases. After that, many inflammasome complexes have been examined in the disease context, including neurodegeneration and AD, such as AIM2. However, in the brain, NLRP3 is the most studied inflammasome complex to date [165]. Several studies [166-169] have demonstrated that A β and tau can activate microglial NLRP3 inflammasomes upon phagocytosis by TLRs and other scavenger receptors. Once A β is internalized, it can disrupt lysosomes, being released into the cytosol. This intracellular presence of A β triggers the assembly of the NLRP3 inflammasomes, leading to the production of cleaved-caspase-1 and IL-1 β and the release of proinflammatory cytokines. This sustained neuroinflammation in the brain can exacerbate neuronal damage and accelerate the cognitive decline observed in AD patients. Moreover, chronic inflammation and the persistent release of inflammatory cytokines can enhance both A β and tau pathologies by disrupting the normal processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP), promoting the formation and aggregation of toxic A β oligomers. Additionally, it fosters the abnormal phosphorylation and aggregation of tau protein, ultimately resulting in the formation of NFTs. [167,168,170]. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome is not only activated by fibrous A β aggregates but also by lower-molecular-weight A β oligomers and fibrils, suggesting that the innate immune response of the CNS triggered by A β may occur before the onset of A β plaques [171,172]. These studies support the hypothesis that inflammation is not merely a consequence of AD pathology, but rather a contributing factor that actively promotes the progression of the disease.\\n\\nIn 2014, Franklin et al. [173] introduced a groundbreaking concept in the field, suggesting that following inflammasome activation, ASC specks are released into the extracellular matrix through either pyroptotic or non-pyroptotic pathways. These specks remain functionally active, facilitating the recruitment of additional phagocytic cells to the site of inflammation. Once in the extracellular matrix, ASC specks can be taken up by phagocytic\\n\\ncells, where they may undergo degradation or function as exogenous danger signals, further amplifying inflammasome activation and propagating inflammation in a prionoid-like manner, similar to fibrillar protein aggregates like A β , tau, and α -synuclein [173]. Additionally, studies have indicated that ASC specks possess an inherent ability to co-aggregate cytosolic proteins on their surface through non-specific hydrophobic interactions, suggesting a potential role for ASC as a scaffold for other aggregation-prone proteins [162,174]. In 2017, Venegas et al. [170] showed that extracellular ASC specks directly promote A β aggregation both in vitro and in vivo. Cultured mouse microglia release ASC specks upon exposure to A β . Moreover, purified ASC specks incubated with A β accelerated the aggregation speed in a concentration-dependent manner. These in vitro findings were confirmed with in vivo experiments. An immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem human brain tissue and APP/PS1 mice revealed the presence of ASC aggregates within the core of extracellular A β plaques. Notably, APP/PS1 crossed with Asc -/ -mice exhibited reduced A β plaque deposition and the attenuation of memory deficits. Furthermore, the injection of APP/PS1 brain lysates into the hippocampus of APP/PS1 mice led to an increase in the size and number of A β plaques compared to the non-injected contralateral side; this seeding effect was reduced in Asc -/ -mice or when a neutralizing ASC antibody was co-injected with the brain lysate. Collectively, these findings underscore the role of ASC aggregates as scaffolds for the cross-seeding of A β , exacerbating amyloid pathology [170].\\n\\n## 4.4.3. Therapeutic Targeting of Inflammasomes in AD\\n\\nTargeting inflammasome components represents a promising therapeutic strategy against AD by addressing the neuroinflammatory processes that exacerbate disease pathology. Studies [20,167,168,170] have shown that the inhibition of NLRP3, ASC, Caspase-1, or IL-1 β can reduce A β deposition, tau pathology, and neuroinflammation, suggesting that targeting these components can mitigate the neurodegenerative processes underlying AD. Heneka et al. demonstrated that Nlrp3 -/ -and Caspase-1 -/ -APP/PS1 mice were protected from neurobehavioral disturbances compared to APP/PS1 mice with an intact NLRP3 inflammasome cascade. Additionally, hippocampal synaptic plasticity was preserved, and the A β plaque load was reduced in both the hippocampus and cortex, with the enhanced microglial phagocytosis of A β plaques [167]. Furthermore, Ising et al. showed reduced levels of p-tau in Nlrp3 -/ -crossed with the Tau22 mouse model [168,170]. Despite the extensive evidence, these results have been recently challenged by Srinivasan et al., as conditional or global Nlrp3 and Caspase-1 knockout failed to rescue AD pathology in App NL-G-F and APP/PS1 mice [175]. Nevertheless, based on these findings, several inhibitors, antibodies, and therapies are being developed at pre-clinical and clinical trial stages, showing promising results and offering a hopeful outlook for the treatment of AD.\\n\\n## NLRP3 Inhibitors\\n\\nSmall-molecule inhibitors targeting the NLRP3 inflammasome, such as MCC950 (also known as CRID3) [176,177], CY-09 [178], and OLT1177 (dapansutrile) [179], have shown efficacy in preclinical models of AD by attenuating inflammasome activation, reducing neuroinflammation, and ameliorating cognitive deficits [165,171]. These inhibitors block NLRP3 assembly or activation, thereby suppressing the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 β and IL-18. MCC950, developed by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer, and CY-09, developed by a research team led by Dr. Hongbo Luo, both inhibit NLRP3 by targeting its NACHT domain. This domain is crucial for the ATP/GTPase activity necessary for the activation and oligomerization of NLRP3 [176,178,180]. Preclinical studies of MCC950 conducted in APP/PS1 mice and Long-Evans rats infused with A β oligomers have demonstrated an improvement in cognitive function compared to vehicle-treated counterparts. Additionally, MCC950 treatment resulted in reduced A β plaque accumulation, a decreased activation of microglial cells, and lower levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines [177,181]. CY-09, although primarily studied in other inflammatory diseases, has shown promise in reducing NLRP3-related inflammation [178,182]. OLT1177 (dapansutrile), developed by the\\n\\npharmaceutical company Olatec Therapeutics, binds specifically and strongly to NLRP3, interfering with the oligomerization process [179]. In recent studies performed in APP/PS1 mice, OLT1177 rescued spatial learning and memory, reduced microglia activation as well as cortical plaque burden, and normalized plasma AD metabolic markers [183]. Moreover, OLT1177, although focused on other inflammatory diseases, is currently in several clinical trials for acute gouty arthritis [165,171].\\n\\nOther NLRP3 inhibitors tested in pre-clinical stages for AD include tranilast [184], JC124 [185,186], oridonin (Ori) [187], and BAY 11-7082 [188]. Tranilast, initially developed as an anti-allergic drug by Kissei Pharmaceutical Co., was repurposed as a direct NLRP3 inhibitor that can inhibit its oligomerization and NLRP3-NLRP3 interactions. Studies have reported that Tranilast can improve cognitive behavioral parameters and significantly increase memory-related proteins in A β -induced cognitive deficit model mice [171,189]. JC124, developed by MedKoo Biosciences, has demonstrated promising results in studies conducted on APP/PS1 mice and CRND8 APP transgenic mice. It improved cognitive function and reduced A β deposition, accompanied by a decreased β -cleavage of APP, reduced microglial activation, and enhanced astrocytosis. Furthermore, JC124 treatment decreased oxidative stress, indicating a possible neuroprotective effect [185,186]. Oridonin (Ori), the main bioactive component of the natural anti-inflammatory Chinese medicinal herb Rabdosia rubescens, has been identified as a specific covalent inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome [171,187]. Ori has shown efficacy in reducing pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and inhibiting the NFκ B signaling pathway in cultured neuronal cells treated with A β to induce neuroinflammation. In mice treated with A β to induce A β -like pathology, Ori inhibited microglial activation, reduced inflammatory cytokine release, prevented synaptic loss, and improved cognitive impairment [190,191].\\n\\nOther NLRP3 inhibitors in clinical trials at different stages, although not tested in AD, that could represent a possible therapy against neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative disorders include DFV890 (IFM-2427), selnoflast, inzomelid (IZD174), NT-0796, RRX-001, VTX2735, and ZYIL1 [165].\\n\\n## ASC Speck Disruption\\n\\nStudies suggest that targeting and disrupting the assembly and polymerization of ASC specks can reduce inflammation and treat inflammatory diseases [192], like gout, arthritis [193,194], and multiple sclerosis [195]. While this strategy has not been thoroughly tested in AD so far, drug-targeting ASC speck formation could potentially mitigate inflammasome-mediated pathology in AD, as observed in AD mice models with ASC deficiency ( Asc -/ -) [168,170]. Various approaches, including small-molecule inhibitors and antibodies, have shown promise in this regard. For instance, small-molecule inhibitors of ASC have emerged as an attractive option to treat inflammatory diseases. MM01 [192], a novel small-molecule inhibitor of ASC oligomerization, has demonstrated a highly specific inhibition of ASC-mediated pro-caspase-1 activation, accompanied by ASC speck disruption, and a reduced secretion of IL-1 β and IL-18 in in vitro models. In a mouse model of inflammasome-induced peritonitis, MM01 significantly reduced inflammation, suggesting the potential of MM01 to treat multifactorial diseases involving the dysregulation of inflammasomes [192]. Similarly, antibodies against ASC have been explored as potential treatments for various inflammatory diseases. IC100, a novel humanized monoclonal IgG4 antibody targeting ASC, developed by ZyVersa Therapeutics, has been shown to improve functional outcomes in animal models of multiple sclerosis (MS) by reducing disease severity and suppressing immune cell infiltration in the CNS [195]. Taken together, these studies confirm that disrupting ASC specks represents a promising therapeutic strategy for treating various inflammatory diseases and has great potential for clinical applications.\\n\\nOther strategies to disrupt ASC speck formation and inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation that have been tested in AD models and patients involve modulating their metabolism through ketogenic diets, caloric restriction, or fasting [196]. Studies have shown that the long-term administration of ketogenic formulas can improve cognitive\\n\\nfunction in AD patients [196,197]. A specific ketone body produced during such metabolic changes, β -hydroxybutyrate (BHB), is of special interest since it has been shown to be able to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome activation by preventing K+ efflux and reducing ASC oligomerization and speck formation [196]. In pre-clinical studies conducted in the 5xFAD mouse model of AD, reduced plaque and ASC speck formation as well as reduced caspase-1 activation was observed after the exogenous administration of BHB [198]. These findings suggest that BHB could alleviate AD pathology. In addition, the capability of BHB to cross the BBB increases its attractiveness and therapeutic potential as a treatment strategy against AD[171].\\n\\n## Caspase-1 Inhibitors\\n\\nCaspase-1 inhibitors hold promise as potential therapeutic targets for AD treatment, either alone or in combination with other therapeutic approaches. They exert anti-inflammatory effects by reducing the production and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, potentially preserving neuronal function and slowing disease progression. Studies have identified potential caspase-1 inhibitors that show potential in preclinical AD studies, including VX-765 [199-201] and Ac-YVAD-cmk [202-204]. Caspase-1 inhibitors work by binding to the active site of caspase-1, preventing the enzyme from cleaving and activating pro-inflammatory cytokines [205]. VX-765, developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, is a non-toxic inhibitor that can permeate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Studies conducted in AD mice models have shown that VX-765 can prevent progressive A β deposition and reverse brain inflammation, synaptic loss, and memory impairment. The preventive usage of VX-765 before the onset of AD symptoms in the AD J20 mice model has shown a delay in cognitive impairment [199,201]. Moreover, VX-765 has shown promise in other central nervous system (CNS) disorders, such as models of multiple sclerosis [200] and epilepsy, with ongoing phase II clinical trials [171]. Ac-YVAD-cmk is a highly selective, cell-permeable, potent, and irreversible inhibitor against caspase-1. It has been shown to be effective in reducing inflammation in the CNS, inhibiting cell pyroptosis, improving neurological function, and providing a neuroprotective effect in various animal models, including for intracerebral hemorrhages [202,203]. In AD, Ac-YVAD-cmk treatment has been shown to improve spatial learning and memory impairment in APP/PS1 mice and reduce A β plaque deposition [204].\\n\\n## 4.5. Cytosolic DNA Sensors\\n\\nThe sensing of DNA as a dangerous signal has been known for many decades, and it plays an important role in the fast activation of an immune response upon infection. Nucleic acids from microbes, either viruses or bacteria, induce an antiviral response characterized by the release of type I interferons (IFN I) and the induction of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and other pro-inflammatory mediators, restricting the propagation and spread of the infection [206-208]. In recent years, it has been shown that the sensing of endogenous DNAcan serve as a surveillance mechanism of cellular stress signals, including failure with autophagy, mitochondrial stress with mitochondrial-DNA (mtDNA) leakage, or genotoxic DNAdamage with genomic DNA (gDNA) cytosolic exposure [209-212]. This aspect holds particular importance in cells that present higher DNA damage response activation, like epithelial cells being exposed to UV light, cancer, and senescent cells, or that are more vulnerable to mitochondrial stress, like nerve and heart cells.\\n\\nCytosolic DNA sensors include various protein complexes that have different structures, DNA binding modes, molecular activation, cell type distributions, changing expression levels, and locations within the cell, characteristics that are related to their biological effects on health and disease. They all share the common function of detecting foreign DNAand self-DNA and triggering a type I interferon response [213,214]. In mammals, the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) appears to be the most important innate immune DNA sensor. Upon its activation by DNA binding, cGAS undergoes conformational changes allowing for the enzymatic production of 2 ′ 3 ′ cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). This molecule\\n\\nacts as a secondary messenger and potent activator of stimulator of interferon genes protein (STING). The identification of cGAS and its enzymatic function in producing cyclic dinucleotide represented the missing link between DNA detection and STING activation, which was already described as important for the antiviral response against pathogenic DNA[215-219]. Studies over the past years have shed light on the functioning of this enzyme. In summary, the C-terminal region of human cGAS (h-cGAS) represents the catalytic section and presents positively charged DNA binding sites. These consist of a primary site and two additional sites that interact with DNA. When DNA binds to the primary site, it triggers conformational changes in the protein that rearrange the catalytic pocket, facilitating an optimal interaction with ATP and GTP substrates. The binding of DNA to the adjacent B-site is essential for forming the core 2:2 cGAS-DNA complex, which is the minimal active enzymatic unit. On extended dsDNA molecules, cGAS dimers organize into ladder-like networks and phase-separated organelles. This activation mechanism provides a vital safeguard for cells: cGAS signaling is only initiated when longer dsDNA stretches are present in the cytoplasm, ensuring a sufficient signaling threshold is reached. Normally, the DNAs of human self-cells are not exposed enough to trigger cGAS, and this is due to a tight regulation of this DNA sensor's activity by enzymatic degradation or binding to inhibitors, avoiding inducing autoimmunity [220,221].\\n\\nOnce cGAMP is produced by cGAS it quickly diffuses throughout the cell and binds to STING, a transmembrane protein located on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). STING consists of a short cytosolic N-terminal segment, a four-span transmembrane domain, a connector region, and a cytosolic ligand-binding domain (LBD) with an appended Cterminal tail (CTT). STING is synthesized, modified, and resides as a homodimer in the ER. cGAMP binding causes conformational changes that allow for the exit of STING from the ER, and through ER-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) translocation to the Golgi [208,222-225]. These changes permit the binding of tank-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and its activation, with the phosphorylation of TBK1 and STING. Phosphorylated STING binds to a positively charged region of the transcription factor interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), allowing for its phosphorylation by TBK1. Phosphorylated IRF3 forms dimers and translocates into the nucleus to activate IFN genes and ISGs. Besides activating IFNs, STING has also been reported to activate NFκ B-mediated transcription, inducing the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNFα , IL-1 β , IL-6, CXCL10, CCL5, and others [208,226-228].\\n\\nBefore the discovery of cGAS, other DNA sensors were described. Among them, interferon-gamma-induced protein 16 (IFI16, also known as P204 in mice) and absent in melanoma 2 protein (AIM2) both belong to the pyrin and hematopoietic interferoninducible nuclear (PYHIN) family [214,229-231]. Similar to cGAS, AIM2 and IFI16 bind with DNA in a sequence-independent and a length-dependent manner. Instead of producing a secondary messenger to induce STING activation, these sensors can bind through PYDPYD interaction with ASC to form inflammasomes and the induction of pro-inflammatory response, as previously described. IFI16 bound to DNA has also been shown to directly bind with STING, trigger the TBK1-IRF3 pathway, and cooperate with cGAS to sense DNA and amplify its response [232,233]. Other researchers proposed that IFI16 plays a role in inhibiting the cGAS-mediated immune effect by competing for DNA [234]. IFI16 also acts as a dual regulator in p53-mediated cell checkpoint control and has been shown to play an important role in cell cycle arrest, senescence, and apoptosis [229]. Other less-explored cytoplasmic DNA sensors are DNA-dependent activators of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI), also known as DNA-binding protein 1 (ZBP1) and DEAD-box helicase 41 (DDX41). ZBP1 mainly binds with Z-form DNA, and upon activation, both receptor-interacting protein kinase 1(RIPK1) and RIPK3 can bind via homotypic interactions with receptor-interacting protein homotypic interaction motifs (RHIMs). Lastly, the C-terminus also contributes to ZBP1-mediated IFN-I production by recruiting the TBK1-IRF3 complex [235]. In contrast, DDX41 binds to a single strand of DNA and mainly triggers STING-TBK1-IRF3-IFN β signaling through direct STING binding [236].\\n\\n## 4.5.1. GAS-STING Pathway in AD\\n\\nGrowing evidence has indicated that dysregulation in DNA sensing, particularly from the cGAS-STING axis, plays an important role in driving inflammatory responses in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HT), TBI, and FTD, and more recently, AD[237-245]. Pathological features of neurodegenerative diseases include inflammation, protein aggregation, defective proteostasis, defects in DNA and RNA homeostasis, altered energy metabolism, synaptic and neuronal network dysfunction, cytoskeletal abnormalities, and neuronal cell death, all of which can influence the release of self-DNA into the cytoplasm and lead to the activation of cGAS under sterile conditions. For example, the loss of genomic integrity during DNA replication or damage can lead to the formation of micronuclei, which can rupture and release chromosomal DNA into the cytosol, triggering cGAS activation. Similarly, cytoplasmic chromatin fragments (CCFs) can accumulate through the autophagic removal of nuclear DNA or DNA leakage from the nucleus during cellular senescence and aging. Additionally, mitochondrial stress or damage can release mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol. cGAS can also detect DNA/RNA hybrids, which can originate from the retrotranscription of retroviruses or endogenous retroviral elements, among other sources. In the CNS, cGAS and STING are mainly found in microglial cells, but recent findings have shown expression in other cell types, such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and neurons under specific conditions, such as chronic inflammation and aging [212,246].\\n\\nIn order to identify a relationship between the type I IFN signature observed in AD patients and cGAS signaling, researchers have studied the role of this immune pathway in multiple models of AD [247-250]. Elegant results showing microglial cGAS-STING activation were obtained using the 5xFAD model, in which nucleic acid-containing A β plaques induced an interferon response. Blocking IFNAR with an inhibitory antibody significantly reduced microglial activation, highlighting the involvement of nucleic acidsensing innate immune pathways in AD pathogenesis [247]. Similar results were obtained by Xie et al., who observed that cGAS binds cytosolic dsDNA and becomes activated in human AD brains. Furthermore, they found phosphorylated STING and IRF3 colocalized with the activated microglia marker CD68 around A β plaques in the dentate gyrus of 5xFAD mice, suggesting cGAS-STING pathway activation. Deleting cGAS in these mice alleviated cognitive impairment, reduced A β pathology, decreased ISG expression in the hippocampus, and inhibited neurotoxic reactive astrocyte formation. Additionally, A β -induced neurotoxicity was partially mitigated with Cgas -/ -astrocyte-conditioned media, indicating that cGAS-STING may regulate the neuroinflammatory response via a microglia-astrocyte-neuron signaling pathway [214]. Studying the APP/PS1 amyloid mouse model, Hou et al. found that the induced inflammation in their brains was correlated with reduced levels of NAD+ and that treatment with an NAD+ precursor increased brain NAD+ levels, reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, and decreased the activation of microglia and astrocytes, with reduced NLRP3 inflammasome expression, DNAdamage, apoptosis, and cellular senescence in the AD mouse brains, dependent on the cGAS-STING [251].\\n\\nPolyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) has also been related to inflammation towards tau protein. PQBP1, a sensor of the cGAS-dependent innate response to HIV-1, binds to reverse-transcribed HIV-1 DNA and interacts with cGAS. Extrinsic tau proteins were found to bind to PQBP1 and activate microglia in a cGAS-STING-dependent manner and induce the nuclear translocation of NF κ B in vitro. In vivo, the microglia-specific deletion of Pqbp1 prevented PQBP1 colocalization with tau, the nuclear translocation of NF κ B, cGAS recruitment, reduced inflammatory gene expression, and rescued cognitive deficits in an acute tau protein injection model [239]. A recent study found that cGAS-STING is activated in the P301S tauopathy mouse model and human AD brains with high tau pathology levels. They observed that pathogenic tau activates cGAS in microglia, partly by causing mtDNA to leak into the cytosol, with the induction of IFN-inducible cytokines like CXCL10 and\\n\\nCCL5 and the upregulation of ISGs such as Stat1, Trim30a, and Ddx60. Deleting Cgas in the P301S mice reduced tauopathy-induced microglial IFN-I, protected against synapse loss, synaptic plasticity deficits, and cognitive impairment, though it did not affect tau pathology levels. Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of excitatory and inhibitory neuronal populations in P301S Cgas -/ -hippocampi revealed the robust restoration of MEF2C transcriptional targets, a key factor in cognitive resilience against AD pathology [240]. The promising results obtained from pre-clinical models of AD demonstrate that cGAS and STING are unconventional but potentially druggable therapeutic targets covering different inflammatory mechanisms of action compared with current approaches to treat AD.\\n\\n## 4.5.2. Therapeutic Targeting of the cGAS-STING-IFN Axis\\n\\nThe cGAS and STING inhibitors that have been reported to date and are advancing in clinical development were mainly investigated in the context of cancer [252]. The pharmacological inhibition of cGAS by the brain penetrant molecule TDI-8246 in mice with tauopathy restored synaptic integrity, plasticity, and memory. This was accompanied by an enhanced neuronal MEF2C transcriptional network, suggesting the cGAS-IFN-MEF2C axis bolsters resilience against AD-related pathological insults [240]. The STING inhibitor H-151 was also reported to suppress the activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and ameliorate ADpathogenesis in 5 × FAD mice [242]. These results coincide with the reported effects of this inhibitor in aging mice, in which the blockade of STING suppressed the inflammatory phenotypes of senescent human cells and tissues, including mice brains, and led to an improvement in tissue function [253]. This points out the important relationship between aging, the cGAS-STING pathway, and AD development.\\n\\n## 5. Conclusions\\n\\nNeuroinflammation is not only a mere contributor but can also be a driving force behind AD pathophysiology and progression. Several studies testing antibodies, inhibitors, agonists, and diets targeting neuroinflammation have brought hope for improved therapy in AD (Table 1). However, the complexity of immune interactions poses an important obstacle to address in drug research. Acute neuroinflammation is necessary for maintaining brain homeostasis while the sustained overactivation of the innate immune system can be a priming factor for disease development and exacerbate its progression. A great example of this are microglia, which are crucial in brain development, in maintaining homeostasis, and in the response to DAMPs/PAMPs, including the clearance of A β . However, their chronic activation leads to impaired A β removal, synapse engulfment, and neuronal damage, resulting in neurodegeneration. Thus, it is necessary to find the right balance of specific immune system components to avoid detrimental side effects. Moreover, it is important to consider the best time window and the administration routes as well as interactions with genetic and environmental factors to increase the probability of success in clinical studies. However, the intricacy of the immune system has also advantages as it presents multiple promising targets for therapeutic modification: from specific immune cell modulators, through pro-inflammatory cytokines to multiprotein complexes. Therefore, the further understanding of the innate immune system within the context of neurodegeneration should be the main focus as it provides new directions for medical intervention in AD.\\n\\nTable 1.

              "Alzheimer &#x27; s disease (AD), one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases worldwide, has a devastating personal, familial, and societal impact. In spite of profound investment and effort, numerous clinical trials targeting amyloidβ , which is thought to have a causative role in the disease, have not yielded any clinically meaningful success to date. Iron is an essential cofactor in many physiological processes in the brain. An extensive body of work links iron dyshomeostasis with multiple aspects of the pathophysiology of AD. In particular, regional iron load appears to be a risk factor for more rapid cognitive decline. Existing ironchelating agents have been in use for decades for other indications, and there are preliminary data that some of these could be effective in AD. Many novel iron-chelating compounds are under development, some with in vivo data showing potential Alzheimer &#x27; s disease-modifying properties. This heretofore underexplored therapeutic class has considerable promise and could yield much-needed agents that slow neurodegeneration in AD.\n",

To date, several dozen phase 3 trials have failed to meet primary endpoints. Recently, studies of aducanumab, a monoclonal antibody with promising initial data, were terminated after a futility analysis only to be revived when further data were analyzed in spite of controversy over these results due to the potential of unblinding [5, 6]. Some argue that the use of anti-amyloidβ therapeutics in the symptomatic stage of AD may be too late. This hypothesis is being tested in ongoing trials in presymptomatic amyloid-positive individuals at risk of sporadic AD [7] and in people with mutations in genes associated with dominantly inherited AD [8], but the multiple failures of prior amyloidβ -lowering agents does not bode well for the outcome of these studies. Furthermore, it is well-established that amyloidβ is often present in healthy older brains [9]. These data shed mounting doubt on the validity of the amyloid cascade hypothesis and whether amyloid-lowering therapeutics have any prospect of clinically meaningful efficacy. New aspects of neurodegeneration in AD need to be explored in order to pave the way to diseasemodifying therapeutics.\n",

            "\n",
            "4. **Inflammasomes**:\n",
            "   - Inflammasomes are multi-protein complexes that regulate inflammatory responses. Their activation leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. Targeting these pathways could mitigate neuroinflammation [1].\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Cytosolic DNA Sensors**:\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Microglia Function**:\n",
            "   - Microglia are the primary immune cells in the CNS. Their dysfunction is linked to AD pathogenesis. Restoring normal microglial function could improve overall health outcomes [1].\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Glial Cell-Mediated Neuroinflammation**:\n",
            "   - Glial cells, including astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, interact with microglia to regulate inflammation. Understanding these interactions could lead to new therapeutic strategies [1][2].\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Neuroinflammation**:\n",

            "\n",
            "### Immune Pathways\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Inflammation**\n",
            "   - Inflammation plays a significant role in AD pathogenesis. Microglia, the resident macrophages of the central nervous system, respond to amyloid-β deposition by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, TNF-α, and IL-1β.\n",
            "   - Targeting these inflammatory mediators could help reduce inflammation and potentially slow disease progression.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Amyloid Processing**\n",
            "   - The amyloid cascade hypothesis suggests that the accumulation of soluble oligomers of amyloid-β leads to neuronal damage. Drugs targeting amyloid processing enzymes like β-secretase (BACE1), γ-secretase, or inhibitors of amyloid aggregation may be effective in reducing amyloid burden.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Microglial Activation**\n",
            "   - Activated microglia can either promote or suppress neurodegeneration depending on their activation state. Therapies aimed at modulating microglial activation states might help balance beneficial versus harmful effects.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Toll-Like Receptors (TLRs)**\n",
            "   - TLRs recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns and danger signals. Modulation of TLR signaling pathways could influence the immune response and potentially affect AD progression.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Complement System**\n",
            "   - Complement proteins play a critical role in innate immunity. Blockade of complement components like C1q or C3 may prevent excessive inflammation and tissue damage.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Microglia-Related Pathways\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Microglial Phagocytosis**\n",
            "   - Enhancing microglial phagocytic activity through pharmacological interventions could clear amyloid-β deposits more efficiently.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Microglial M1/M2 Balance**\n",
            "   - Balancing the ratio between pro-inflammatory M1 and anti-inflammatory M2 microglia could shift the immune response towards a more protective state.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Autophagy**\n",
            "   - Autophagy is a cellular process involved in clearing damaged organelles and misfolded proteins. Enhancing autophagic function within microglia could improve their ability to remove toxic aggregates.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Neuroinflammation**\n",
            "   - Neuroinflammatory processes involving microglia contribute significantly to AD pathology. Targeting specific molecules involved in this pathway could mitigate neuroinflammation and protect neurons from further damage.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Glial Cell Line-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (GDNF)**\n",
            "   - GDNF promotes survival and differentiation of dopaminergic neurons and has shown promise in animal models of AD.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Astrocytes**\n",
            "   - Astrocytes support neuronal health by providing metabolic substrates and maintaining homeostasis. Interventions that enhance astrocyte function could indirectly benefit AD patients.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) Dysfunction**\n",
            "   - BBB dysfunction allows peripheral immune cells and inflammatory molecules to enter the brain, exacerbating AD symptoms. Restoring BBB integrity could limit inflammation and neurodegeneration.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Oxidative Stress**\n",
            "   - Oxidative stress contributes to neuronal injury and cognitive decline in AD. Antioxidants and other compounds that neutralize reactive oxygen species may provide therapeutic benefits.\n",
            "\n",
            "9. **Tau Pathway**\n",
            "   - Tau phosphorylation and aggregation lead to neurofibrillary tangles. Strategies targeting tau kinases or chaperones could stabilize tau protein and prevent its aggregation.\n",

            "Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the accumulation of amyloid-β plaques and tau tangles in the brain, leading to cognitive decline and dementia.\n",
            "\n",
            "The earliest detectable signs of AD-related pathology often occur many years or even decades before any noticeable symptoms appear. Here are some key points regarding this:\n",
            "\n",
            "1. **Preclinical Stage**: \n",
            "   - Pathological changes such as amyloid deposition and tau aggregation start long before clinical symptoms become apparent. This preclinical stage typically begins around 20–30 years prior to symptom onset.\n",
            "   \n",
            "2. **Amyloid Plaque Formation**:\n",
            "   - Amyloid-β proteins form extracellular plaques that accumulate in the brain. These plaques can be detected using imaging techniques like PET scans with amyloid ligands.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Tau Protein Aggregation**:\n",
            "   - Tau proteins form intracellular tangles within neurons. These tangles can also be identified through imaging or post-mortem analysis.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Neuroinflammation and Neurodegeneration**:\n",
            "   - In addition to amyloid and tau pathologies, there is evidence of chronic inflammation and neuronal loss occurring during the preclinical phase.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Genetic Factors**:\n",
            "   - Certain genetic mutations associated with familial forms of AD (e.g., APP, PSEN1, PSEN2 genes) may accelerate the development of these pathologies earlier than sporadic cases.\n",
            "\n",
            "6. **Cognitive Impairment**:\n",
            "   - By the time symptoms manifest, significant damage has already occurred in the brain. At this point, patients may experience memory loss, difficulty with language, and other cognitive impairments.\n",
            "\n",
            "7. **Imaging Techniques**:\n",
            "   - Modern imaging technologies allow researchers to identify these pathologies at an early stage. For example, positron emission tomography (PET) scans using radiotracers specific for amyloid or tau can provide insights into the extent of pathological changes.\n",
            "\n",
            "8. **Biomarkers**:\n",
            "   - Blood-based biomarker panels have been developed to help predict the presence of AD-related pathologies even before symptoms arise.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, Alzheimer's-related pathology can begin up to two decades before symptoms emerge, making it crucial to develop strategies for early detection and intervention.\n",
